<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p class="noindent">The character and credit of the British Army must
chiefly depend upon the zeal and ardour by which
all who enter into its service are animated, and
consequently it is of the highest importance that any
measure calculated to excite the spirit of emulation,
by which alone great and gallant actions are achieved,
should be adopted.</p>

<p>Nothing can more fully tend to the accomplishment
of this desirable object than a full display of the noble
deeds with which the Military History of our country
abounds. To hold forth these bright examples to
the imitation of the youthful soldier, and thus to
incite him to emulate the meritorious conduct of those
who have preceded him in their honorable career,
are among the motives that have given rise to the
present publication.</p>

<p>The operations of the British Troops are, indeed,
announced in the "London Gazette," from whence
they are transferred into the public prints: the
achievements of our armies are thus made known at
the time of their occurrence, and receive the tribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
of praise and admiration to which they are entitled.
On extraordinary occasions, the Houses of Parliament
have been in the habit of conferring on the Commanders,
and the Officers and Troops acting under
their orders, expressions of approbation and of thanks
for their skill and bravery; and these testimonials,
confirmed by the high honour of their Sovereign's
approbation, constitute the reward which the soldier
most highly prizes.</p>

<p>It has not, however, until late years, been the practice
(which appears to have long prevailed in some of
the Continental armies) for British Regiments to keep
regular records of their services and achievements.
Hence some difficulty has been experienced in obtaining,
particularly from the old Regiments, an authentic
account of their origin and subsequent services.</p>

<p>This defect will now be remedied, in consequence
of His Majesty having been pleased to command
that every Regiment shall, in future, keep a full and
ample record of its services at home and abroad.</p>

<p>From the materials thus collected, the country
will henceforth derive information as to the difficulties
and privations which chequer the career of those who
embrace the military profession. In Great Britain,
where so large a number of persons are devoted to
the active concerns of agriculture, manufactures,
and commerce, and where these pursuits have, for so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
long a period, being undisturbed by the <em>presence of
war</em>, which few other countries have escaped, comparatively
little is known of the vicissitudes of active
service and of the casualties of climate, to which,
even during peace, the British Troops are exposed in
every part of the globe, with little or no interval of
repose.</p>

<p>In their tranquil enjoyment of the blessings which
the country derives from the industry and the enterprise
of the agriculturist and the trader, its happy
inhabitants may be supposed not often to reflect on
the perilous duties of the soldier and the sailor,&mdash;on
their sufferings,&mdash;and on the sacrifice of valuable life,
by which so many national benefits are obtained and
preserved.</p>

<p>The conduct of the British Troops, their valour,
and endurance, have shone conspicuously under great
and trying difficulties; and their character has been
established in Continental warfare by the irresistible
spirit with which they have effected debarkations in
spite of the most formidable opposition, and by the
gallantry and steadiness with which they have maintained
their advantages against superior numbers.</p>

<p>In the official Reports made by the respective Commanders,
ample justice has generally been done to
the gallant exertions of the Corps employed; but
the details of their services and of acts of individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
bravery can only be fully given in the Annals of the
various Regiments.</p>

<p>These Records are now preparing for publication,
under his Majesty's special authority, by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Richard Cannon</span>, Principal Clerk of the Adjutant
General's Office; and while the perusal of them cannot
fail to be useful and interesting to military men
of every rank, it is considered that they will also
afford entertainment and information to the general
reader, particularly to those who may have served in
the Army, or who have relatives in the Service.</p>

<p>There exists in the breasts of most of those who
have served, or are serving, in the Army, an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit
de Corps</i>&mdash;an attachment to everything belonging
to their Regiment; to such persons a narrative of
the services of their own Corps cannot fail to prove
interesting. Authentic accounts of the actions of
the great, the valiant, the loyal, have always been
of paramount interest with a brave and civilized
people. Great Britain has produced a race of heroes
who, in moments of danger and terror, have stood
"firm as the rocks of their native shore:" and when
half the world has been arrayed against them, they
have fought the battles of their Country with unshaken
fortitude. It is presumed that a record of
achievements in war,&mdash;victories so complete and surprising,
gained by our countrymen, our brothers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
our fellow citizens in arms,&mdash;a record which revives
the memory of the brave, and brings their gallant
deeds before us,&mdash;will certainly prove acceptable to
the public.</p>

<p>Biographical Memoirs of the Colonels and other
distinguished Officers will be introduced in the
Records of their respective Regiments, and the
Honorary Distinctions which have, from time to
time, been conferred upon each Regiment, as testifying
the value and importance of its services, will be
faithfully set forth.</p>

<p>As a convenient mode of Publication, the Record
of each Regiment will be printed in a distinct number,
so that when the whole shall be completed, the
Parts may be bound up in numerical succession.</p>

<p class="noindent">The natives of Britain have, at all periods, been
celebrated for innate courage and unshaken firmness,
and the national superiority of the British troops
over those of other countries has been evinced in
the midst of the most imminent perils. History contains
so many proofs of extraordinary acts of bravery,
that no doubts can be raised upon the facts which
are recorded. It must therefore be admitted, that
the distinguishing feature of the British soldier is
<span class="smcap">Intrepidity</span>. This quality was evinced by the
inhabitants of England when their country was
invaded by Julius Cæsar with a Roman army, on
which occasion the undaunted Britons rushed into
the sea to attack the Roman soldiers as they descended
from their ships; and, although their discipline
and arms were inferior to those of their
adversaries, yet their fierce and dauntless bearing
intimidated the flower of the Roman troops, including
Cæsar's favourite tenth legion. Their arms
consisted of spears, short swords, and other weapons
of rude construction. They had chariots, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
axles of which were fastened sharp pieces of iron
resembling scythe-blades, and infantry in long
chariots resembling waggons, who alighted and
fought on foot, and for change of ground, pursuit
or retreat, sprang into the chariot and drove off
with the speed of cavalry. These inventions were,
however, unavailing against Cæsar's legions: in
the course of time a military system, with discipline
and subordination, was introduced, and
British courage, being thus regulated, was exerted
to the greatest advantage; a full development of
the national character followed, and it shone forth
in all its native brilliancy.</p>

<p>The military force of the Anglo-Saxons consisted
principally of infantry: Thanes, and other men of
property, however, fought on horseback. The
infantry were of two classes, heavy and light.
The former carried large shields armed with spikes,
long broad swords and spears; and the latter were
armed with swords or spears only. They had also
men armed with clubs, others with battle-axes and
javelins.</p>

<p>The feudal troops established by William the
Conqueror consisted (as already stated in the Introduction
to the Cavalry) almost entirely of horse;
but when the warlike barons and knights, with their
trains of tenants and vassals, took the field, a proportion
of men appeared on foot, and, although
these were of inferior degree, they proved stout-hearted
Britons of stanch fidelity. When stipendiary
troops were employed, infantry always constituted
a considerable portion of the military force;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
and this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i> has since acquired, in every quarter
of the globe, a celebrity never exceeded by the
armies of any nation at any period.</p>

<p>The weapons carried by the infantry, during the
several reigns succeeding the Conquest, were bows
and arrows, half-pikes, lances, halberds, various
kinds of battle-axes, swords, and daggers. Armour
was worn on the head and body, and in course of
time the practice became general for military men
to be so completely cased in steel, that it was
almost impossible to slay them.</p>

<p>The introduction of the use of gunpowder in the
destructive purposes of war, in the early part of the
fourteenth century, produced a change in the arms
and equipment of the infantry-soldier. Bows and
arrows gave place to various kinds of fire-arms, but
British archers continued formidable adversaries;
and, owing to the inconvenient construction and imperfect
bore of the fire-arms when first introduced,
a body of men, well trained in the use of the bow
from their youth, was considered a valuable acquisition
to every army, even as late as the sixteenth
century.</p>

<p>During a great part of the reign of Queen Elizabeth
each company of infantry usually consisted of
men armed five different ways; in every hundred
men forty were "<em>men-at-arms</em>," and sixty "<em>shot</em>;"
the "men-at-arms" were ten halberdiers, or battle-axe
men, and thirty pikemen; and the "shot" were
twenty archers, twenty musketeers, and twenty
harquebusiers, and each man carried, besides his
principal weapon, a sword and dagger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span></p>

<p>Companies of infantry varied at this period in
numbers from 150 to 300 men; each company had
a colour or ensign, and the mode of formation recommended
by an English military writer (Sir John
Smithe) in 1590 was:&mdash;the colour in the centre of
the company guarded by the halberdiers; the pikemen
in equal proportions, on each flank of the
halberdiers: half the musketeers on each flank of
the pikes; half the archers on each flank of the musketeers,
and the harquebusiers (whose arms were
much lighter than the muskets then in use) in equal
proportions on each flank of the company for skirmishing.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
It was customary to unite a number of companies
into one body, called a <span class="smcap">Regiment</span>, which
frequently amounted to three thousand men: but
each company continued to carry a colour. Numerous
improvements were eventually introduced in the
construction of fire-arms, and, it having been found
impossible to make armour proof against the muskets
then in use (which carried a very heavy ball) without
its being too weighty for the soldier, armour was
gradually laid aside by the infantry in the seventeenth
century: bows and arrows also fell into disuse,
and the infantry were reduced to two classes,
viz.: <em>musketeers</em>, armed with matchlock muskets,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
swords, and daggers; and <em>pikemen</em>, armed with pikes
from fourteen to eighteen feet long, and swords.</p>

<p>In the early part of the seventeenth century
Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, reduced the
strength of regiments to 1000 men. He caused the
gunpowder, which had heretofore been carried in
flasks, or in small wooden bandoliers, each containing
a charge, to be made up into cartridges, and
carried in pouches; and he formed each regiment
into two wings of musketeers, and a centre division
of pikemen. He also adopted the practice of forming
four regiments into a brigade; and the number
of colours was afterwards reduced to three in each
regiment. He formed his columns so compactly that
his infantry could resist the charge of the celebrated
Polish horsemen and Austrian cuirassiers; and his
armies became the admiration of other nations. His
mode of formation was copied by the English,
French, and other European states; but so great
was the prejudice in favour of ancient customs, that
all his improvements were not adopted until near a
century afterwards.</p>

<p>In 1664 King Charles II. raised a corps for sea-service,
styled the Admiral's regiment. In 1678
each company of 100 men usually consisted of 30
pikemen, 60 musketeers, and 10 men armed with
light firelocks. In this year the King added a company
of men armed with hand grenades to each of
the old British regiments, which was designated the
"grenadier company." Daggers were so contrived
as to fit in the muzzles of the muskets, and bayonets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
similar to those at present in use were adopted about
twenty years afterwards.</p>

<p>An Ordnance regiment was raised in 1685, by
order of King James II., to guard the artillery, and
was designated the Royal Fusiliers (now 7th Foot).
This corps, and the companies of grenadiers, did
not carry pikes.</p>

<p>King William III. incorporated the Admiral's
regiment in the second Foot Guards, and raised
two Marine regiments for sea-service. During the
war in this reign, each company of infantry (excepting
the fusiliers and grenadiers) consisted of 14
pikemen and 46 musketeers; the captains carried
pikes; lieutenants, partisans; ensigns, half-pikes;
and serjeants, halberds. After the peace in 1697 the
Marine regiments were disbanded, but were again
formed on the breaking out of the war in 1702.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>During the reign of Queen Anne the pikes were
laid aside, and every infantry soldier was armed
with a musket, bayonet, and sword; the grenadiers
ceased, about the same period, to carry hand grenades;
and the regiments were directed to lay aside
their third colour: the corps of Royal Artillery was
first added to the Army in this reign.</p>

<p>About the year 1745, the men of the battalion
companies of infantry ceased to carry swords; during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
the reign of George II. light companies were added
to infantry regiments; and in 1764 a Board of
General Officers recommended that the grenadiers
should lay aside their swords, as that weapon had
never been used during the Seven Years' War. Since
that period the arms of the infantry soldier have been
limited to the musket and bayonet.</p>

<p>The arms and equipment of the British Troops have
seldom differed materially, since the Conquest, from
those of other European states; and in some respects
the arming has, at certain periods, been allowed to
be inferior to that of the nations with whom they
have had to contend; yet, under this disadvantage,
the bravery and superiority of the British infantry
have been evinced on very many and most trying
occasions, and splendid victories have been gained
over very superior numbers.</p>

<p>Great Britain has produced a race of lion-like
champions who have dared to confront a host of
foes, and have proved themselves valiant with any
arms. At <em>Creçy</em>, King Edward III., at the head of
about 30,000 men, defeated, on the 26th of August,
1346, Philip King of France, whose army is said to
have amounted to 100,000 men; here British valour
encountered veterans of renown:&mdash;the King of Bohemia,
the King of Majorca, and many princes and
nobles were slain, and the French army was routed
and cut to pieces. Ten years afterwards, Edward
Prince of Wales, who was designated the Black
Prince, defeated, at <em>Poictiers</em>, with 14,000 men,
a French army of 60,000 horse, besides infantry,
and took John I., King of France, and his son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
Philip, prisoners. On the 25th of October, 1415,
King Henry V., with an army of about 13,000
men, although greatly exhausted by marches, privations,
and sickness, defeated, at <em>Agincourt</em>, the
Constable of France, at the head of the flower of
the French nobility and an army said to amount to
60,000 men, and gained a complete victory.</p>

<p>During the seventy years' war between the United
Provinces of the Netherlands and the Spanish monarchy,
which commenced in 1578 and terminated
in 1648, the British infantry in the service of the
States-General were celebrated for their unconquerable
spirit and firmness;<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and in the thirty
years' war between the Protestant Princes and the
Emperor of Germany, the British Troops in the service
of Sweden and other states were celebrated for
deeds of heroism.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In the wars of Queen Anne,
the fame of the British army under the great
<span class="smcap">Marlborough</span> was spread throughout the world;
and if we glance at the achievements performed
within the memory of persons now living, there is
abundant proof that the Britons of the present age
are not inferior to their ancestors in the qualities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>which constitute good soldiers. Witness the deeds
of the brave men, of whom there are many now
surviving, who fought in Egypt in 1801, under the
brave Abercromby, and compelled the French army,
which had been vainly styled <em>Invincible</em>, to evacuate
that country; also the services of the gallant
Troops during the arduous campaigns in the Peninsula,
under the immortal <span class="smcap">Wellington</span>; and the
determined stand made by the British Army at
Waterloo, where Napoleon Bonaparte, who had
long been the inveterate enemy of Great Britain,
and had sought and planned her destruction by
every means he could devise, was compelled to
leave his vanquished legions to their fate, and to
place himself at the disposal of the British Government.
These achievements, with others of recent
dates in the distant climes of India, prove that the
same valour and constancy which glowed in the
breasts of the heroes of Creçy, Poictiers, Agincourt,
Blenheim, and Ramilies, continue to animate
the Britons of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>The British Soldier is distinguished for a robust
and muscular frame,&mdash;intrepidity which no danger
can appal,&mdash;unconquerable spirit and resolution,&mdash;patience
in fatigue and privation, and cheerful obedience
to his superiors. These qualities, united with
an excellent system of order and discipline to regulate
and give a skilful direction to the energies and
adventurous spirit of the hero, and a wise selection
of officers of superior talent to command, whose
presence inspires confidence,&mdash;have been the leading
causes of the splendid victories gained by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
British arms.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The fame of the deeds of the past
and present generations in the various battle-fields
where the robust sons of Albion have fought and
conquered, surrounds the British arms with a halo
of glory; these achievements will live in the page
of history to the end of time.</p>

<p>The records of the several regiments will be found
to contain a detail of facts of an interesting character,
connected with the hardships, sufferings,
and gallant exploits of British soldiers in the various
parts of the world where the calls of their Country
and the commands of their Sovereign have
required them to proceed in the execution of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
duty, whether in active continental operations, or
in maintaining colonial territories in distant and
unfavourable climes.</p>

<p>The superiority of the British infantry has been
pre-eminently set forth in the wars of six centuries,
and admitted by the greatest commanders which
Europe has produced. The formations and movements
of this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arme</i>, as at present practised, while
they are adapted to every species of warfare, and
to all probable situations and circumstances of service,
are calculated to show forth the brilliancy of
military tactics calculated upon mathematical and
scientific principles. Although the movements and
evolutions have been copied from the continental
armies, yet various improvements have from time
to time been introduced, to ensure that simplicity
and celerity by which the superiority of the national
military character is maintained. The rank and influence,
which Great Britain has attained among
the nations of the world, have in a great measure
been purchased by the valour of the Army, and to
persons, who have the welfare of their country at
heart, the records of the several regiments cannot
fail to prove interesting.</p>

the successes which have attended the exertions of his troops in
Egypt to that determined bravery which is inherent in Britons; but
His Majesty desires it may be most solemnly and forcibly impressed
on the consideration of every part of the army, that it has been a
strict observance of order, discipline, and military system, which
has given the full energy to the native valour of the troops, and has
enabled them proudly to assert the superiority of the national military
character, in situations uncommonly arduous, and under circumstances
of peculiar difficulty."&mdash;<em>General Orders in 1801.</em>
</p>
<p>
In the General Orders issued by Lieut.-General Sir John Hope
(afterwards Lord Hopetoun), congratulating the army upon the
successful result of the Battle of Corunna, on the 16th of January,
1809, it is stated:&mdash;"On no occasion has the undaunted valour of
British troops ever been more manifest. At the termination of a
severe and harassing march, rendered necessary by the superiority
which the enemy had acquired, and which had materially impaired
the efficiency of the troops, many disadvantages were to be encountered.
These have all been surmounted by the conduct of the troops
themselves; and the enemy has been taught, that whatever advantages
of position or of numbers he may possess, there is inherent
in the British officers and soldiers a bravery that knows not how to
yield,&mdash;that no circumstances can appal,&mdash;and that will ensure victory
when it is to be obtained by the exertion of any human means."</p></div></div>

<p class="noindent">In the winter of 1755, when the attacks made by the
French on the British settlements beyond the Allegany
Mountains, in North America, appeared to render a
war between the two countries inevitable, King George
II. resolved to augment the strength of his regular
army, and a letter of service was addressed to Colonel
William Whitmore, major in the third foot guards,
authorizing him to raise, form, and discipline a regiment
of foot, of ten companies, which was numbered the
<span class="fs70">FIFTY-FIFTH</span>; but two colonial corps being soon afterwards
disbanded, viz., Major-General Shirley's and
Major-General Sir William Pepperell's, which had
been numbered the Fiftieth and Fifty-first regiments,
it obtained rank as <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>This regiment was raised in the south of England:
its uniform was cocked hats; red coats, faced with red,
lined with yellow, and ornamented with yellow lace;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
red waistcoats and breeches, and white gaiters. The
colonelcy was conferred on Colonel William Whitmore,
by commission dated the 21st of December, 1755; the
lieut.-colonelcy was given to Major George Craufurd,
from the thirty-fifth regiment, then in Ireland; and
Captain William Arnot was nominated major.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1756</div>

<p>Early in 1756 the formation of the regiment was
completed, and the following officers were appointed to
commissions in the corps:&mdash;</p>

<p>The formation of the regiment being completed, it
received orders to embark for Gibraltar, and was
stationed at that important fortress during the whole
of the seven years' war, and remained there until 1768.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1758<br />1759</div>

<p>In October, 1758, Colonel Whitmore was removed
to the ninth regiment of foot; and was succeeded in
the colonelcy of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>, in April, 1759, by
Colonel John Toovey, from lieut.-colonel in the royal
dragoons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">1768</div>

<p>The regiment was relieved from duty at the fortress
of Gibraltar in 1768, when it embarked for Ireland,
where it was quartered during the following eight
years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1770</div>

<p>Colonel Toovey died in the early part of the year
1770, and King George III. conferred the colonelcy on
Colonel R. Dalrymple Horne Elphinstone, who had
commanded the 120th regiment of foot, which was
disbanded after the peace in 1763.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1775</div>

<p>While the regiment was stationed in Ireland, the
misunderstanding between Great Britain and her
North American provinces on the subject of taxation,
was followed by open hostilities; and a body of American
troops undertook the siege of <em>Quebec</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1776</div>

<p>In the spring of 1776 the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> and several
other corps proceeded, under Major-General Burgoyne,
for the relief of Quebec: this regiment embarked from
Ireland on the 4th of April, arrived in Canada towards
the end of May, and took part in the operations by
which the American troops were driven from the
confines of the British provinces. During the winter
the regiment was stationed at Chambly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1777</div>

<p>The flank companies of the regiment were selected,
in the spring of 1777, to form part of the force under
Lieut.-General Burgoyne, who was directed to penetrate
the United States from Lake Champlain to the
river Hudson, and advance upon Albany, with the
view of bringing that part of the country into submission
to the British crown. The troops employed on
this service proceeded to Crown Point in boats, and
afterwards moved <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'towards Ticonderago'">towards Ticonderoga</ins>, forcing the
Americans to abandon that post, and pursuing them a
considerable distance. Some fighting occurred, in which
the British soldiers evinced great gallantry, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
companies of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> had opportunities of distinguishing
themselves. The army advanced towards
the river Hudson, encountering much greater difficulties
than had been expected. The country through which
it marched was a wilderness; numerous obstructions had
to be removed, forty bridges had to be constructed, and
others repaired; but every difficulty was overcome by
the cheerful perseverance of the soldiers. Their hardships
were, however, daily augmented; and after passing
the river Hudson, they were opposed by very superior
numbers of the enemy. Several actions occurred, and
British valour was conspicuous; but incessant toil and
a scarcity of provisions reduced the army to 3500 men,
who were environed by 16,000 Americans, and their
retreat cut off. Under these circumstances a convention
was concluded, by which the British agreed to lay down
their arms on condition of being sent to England. The
Americans afterwards violated the conditions of the
convention, and detained the English soldiers some
time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1778<br />1781</div>

<p>Eight companies of the regiment had remained in
Canada, where they were eventually joined by the
flank companies, and the regiment was stationed in
that part of the British dominions several years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1782</div>

<p>The American war terminated in 1782:&mdash;In the
same year the regiment received instructions to assume
the title of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD, OR THE SHROPSHIRE REGIMENT</span>,
and to cultivate a connexion with that county,
which might, at all times, be useful towards recruiting.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1789<br />1790</div>

<p>In the summer of 1789 the regiment, being then in
garrison at Quebec, was relieved by the twenty-fourth
foot, and embarked for England, where it landed on
the 31st of August. It passed the winter at Bridgenorth,
and towards the end of the year 1790 embarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
on board the fleet to serve as marines, on which service
it was employed a short time.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1791<br />1792</div>

<p>Embarking from Plymouth on the 17th of February,
1791, the regiment proceeded to Glasgow, and was
stationed in Scotland during the year 1792.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1793</div>

<p>In the meantime a revolution had taken place in
France, and in 1793 the republicans of that country
beheaded their king. They also attacked the frontiers
of Holland, when a body of British troops was sent to
the Netherlands to take part in the war. The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
regiment was one of the first corps selected to
proceed on foreign service; it embarked from Scotland
in March, and, after landing in Flanders, advanced up
the country to Tournay.</p>

<p>The regiment formed part of the column under the
command of His Royal Highness the Duke of York,
which passed the Ronelle river on the 23rd of May,
and forced the French to quit several batteries of their
strong camp at <em>Famars</em>. It was stated in the public
despatch sent to England on this occasion&mdash;"The troops
of the different nations displayed the utmost firmness
and intrepidity. The British who had an opportunity
of distinguishing themselves, were the fourteenth
and <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiments, with the battalion formed
from the light infantry and grenadier companies,
commanded by Major-General Sir Ralph Abercromby."
The regiment lost four men on this occasion.</p>

<p>This success was followed by the siege of <em>Valenciennes</em>,
in which service the regiment was actively employed,
and had several men killed and wounded. It also
sustained some loss at the storming of the outworks on
the 25th of July, which was followed by the surrender
of the fortress.</p>

<p>From Valenciennes the British troops proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
towards <em>Dunkirk</em>, which place was besieged; but circumstances
occurred which rendered it necessary for
the army to withdraw from this position: and the
<span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment was detached to the town of
<em>Nieuport</em>. The French made a strenuous effort to
capture this place on the 24th of October, by a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-de-main</i>,
when the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> resisted the attack of a
very superior force, with heroic gallantry, and their
commanding officer, Major Robert Matthews, particularly
distinguished himself. The gallant conduct of
the regiment on this occasion excited universal admiration.
Its loss was Lieutenant Phanuel Latham and
ten soldiers killed; Captain Ronald C. Fergusson and
eighteen soldiers wounded. The French continued to
cannonade the place several days, causing the regiment
a further loss of thirteen men; but the garrison being
augmented, the enemy retired. General Sir Charles
(afterwards Earl) Grey, who arrived with a reinforcement,
stated in his despatch&mdash;"The artillery under
Captain Bothwick, with the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment,
whose loss has been greatest, have been very much
distinguished; and I think it only an act of justice
to mention in terms of the highest approbation
Major Matthews (commanding the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>),
whose long services and particular exertions on
this occasion will, I hope, recommend him to His
Majesty's notice."</p>

<p>The Royal authority was given for the regiment to bear
the word "Nieuport" on its colours, to commemorate
its distinguished conduct in the defence of that fortress.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1794</div>

<p>General Elphinstone died in the spring of 1794,
when the colonelcy of the regiment was conferred on
Major-General Gerard Lake, from lieut.-colonel in the
first foot guards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Taking the field in April of this year, the regiment
was engaged in the operations by which the enemy was
driven from his positions at <em>Vaux</em>, <em>Prémont</em>, <em>Marets</em>, &amp;c.,
on the 17th of that month, when the Duke of York
expressed in general orders the sense he entertained of
the bravery and conduct of the troops engaged.</p>

<p>The regiment was subsequently employed in covering
the siege of <em>Landrécies</em>; it was in line on the 26th of
April, when the attack of the French on the British
position at <em>Cateau</em> was repulsed; and after the surrender
of Landrécies, the regiment marched to the vicinity of
Tournay.</p>

<p>On the 10th of May the position near <em>Tournay</em> was
attacked, and the French were repulsed with severe
loss.</p>

<p>A combined attack on the posts occupied by the
French army was made on the 17th of May; when the
<span class="fs70">FOURTEENTH</span>, <span class="fs70">THIRTY-SEVENTH</span>, and <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiments,
forming the second brigade, under Major-General
Fox,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> were attached to the column under the Duke of
York's immediate command, which captured <em>Lannoy</em>,
<em>Roubaix</em>, and <em>Mouveaux</em>; and the three regiments were
afterwards posted on the main road from Lisle to
Roubaix. Meanwhile the failure of the other columns
of the allied army had left the British troops exposed
to the whole weight and power of the enemy's overwhelming
numbers, and early on the 18th of May the
fourteenth, thirty-seventh, and <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiments
were attacked by a numerous force. A historian of
that campaign states,&mdash;"Major-General Fox, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
fourteenth, thirty-seventh, and <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiments,
was engaged with the whole of the column
which had marched from Lisle, and the different corps,
which had driven back the rest of the army, fell upon
his flanks and rear. Perhaps there is not on record a
single instance of greater gallantry and more soldier-like
conduct than was exhibited on that occasion by
these three regiments. At length Major-General Fox,
finding that the whole army had left him, began to
think of retreating; to effect which it was necessary
to get possession of the causeway leading to Leers,
and before that could be accomplished, he was obliged
to charge several battalions of the enemy, who were
astonished that such a handful of men should presume
to give them battle, and expected every moment
that they would lay down their arms; but with a
degree of intrepidity that words cannot describe, and
is, indeed, scarcely conceivable, they gained the
wished-for point; then forming with such regularity
that the enemy could not assail them, they secured
their retreat towards Leers, and the next morning
joined General Otto's column. This brigade, which
consisted of only eleven hundred and twenty men,
left in the field five hundred and thirty-three."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment had Lieutenant John
Rhind, eight serjeants, two drummers, and one hundred
and ninety-one rank and file killed and missing; Major
Thomas Scott, Captain Thomas Brisbane, Ensign E.
Pierce, one serjeant, and fourteen rank and file
wounded.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Resuming its post in front of <em>Tournay</em>, the regiment
was in line on the 22nd of May, when a numerous
French army attacked the position occupied by the
allies. The right wing of the army being pressed by
the enemy, Major-General Fox's brigade was detached
to its support. Speaking of the <span class="fs70">FOURTEENTH</span>, <span class="fs70">THIRTY-SEVENTH</span>,
and <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiments on this occasion,
the Duke of York stated in his despatch, "Nothing
could exceed the spirit and gallantry with which they
conducted themselves, particularly in the storming
of the village of <em>Pontéchin</em>, which they forced with
the bayonet. The enemy immediately began to retreat."
In general orders it was stated, "His Royal
Highness the Commander-in-Chief desires to express
his particular thanks to Major-General Fox; to the
fourteenth regiment, under the command of Major
Ramsey; to the thirty-seventh regiment, commanded
by Captain Lightburne; to the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment,
commanded by Major Wiseman; and to the
detachment of artillery that was attached to them,
under the command of Captain Trotter, for their
intrepidity and good conduct, which reflects the
greatest honor upon themselves, at the same time
that it was highly instrumental in deciding the important
victory of the 22nd instant."</p>

<p>In Jones's Journal it is stated:&mdash;"There never was
a better opportunity of putting British valour to the
test; nor could there be anything more conspicuous
than the proof they gave of what highly disciplined
soldiers, well led on, may be brought to do. It appears
almost impossible; but it is a fact, that a single
British brigade, less than six hundred men, on that
great day absolutely won the battle; for had they
not come up, the allies would have been beaten."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The regiment had six rank and file killed: Lieutenants
Rogers and Robertson, Ensign Pierce, one serjeant,
and twenty-three rank and file wounded; twelve rank
and file missing.</p>

<p>The word "<span class="smcap">Tournay</span>," displayed by royal authority
on the colour of the regiment, commemorates its heroic
conduct on this occasion.</p>

<p>The enemy afterwards acquired so great a superiority
of numbers, that the British army withdrew from its
position, and a series of retrograde movements brought
the army to the banks of the Rhine and the Waal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1795</div>

<p>A severe frost having rendered the rivers passable
on the ice, the British troops retired through Holland
to Germany. The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> shared in the toil,
privation, and suffering occasioned by long marches
through a country covered with ice and snow: in the
spring of 1795 they embarked for England, where
they arrived in May.</p>

<p>The regiment was encamped near Southampton,
where its ranks were completed by drafts from the
109th regiment; in November it embarked for the
West Indies, and afterwards sailed with the armament,
under General Sir Ralph Abercromby, for the conquest
of the French West India Islands. The disasters which
befell this fleet from storms at sea, and the number of
shipwrecks which took place, are recorded in the naval
history of Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1796</div>

<p>Four companies of the regiment, commanded by
Major Brisbane, arrived at Barbadoes in March, 1796,
and they formed part of the armament which proceeded
against <em>St. Lucia</em>; three other companies also
arrived in time to share in the enterprise. A landing
was effected on the 26th and 27th of April, and at
midnight on the last-mentioned day, Brigadier-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
(afterwards Sir John) Moore advanced with seven
companies of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>, under Lieut.-Colonel
John Abercromby, and a detachment of Rangers along
a defile in the mountains, and falling in with the
enemy's post at <em>Morne Chabot</em>, carried it after a considerable
resistance. The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> distinguished
themselves on this occasion; and Sir Ralph Abercromby's
thanks were expressed to the regiment in
orders, accompanied by the declaration that he would
bring its conduct before His Royal Highness the Duke
of York.</p>

<p>The loss of the regiment on this occasion was one
drummer and twelve rank and file killed; Captain
Charles Stuart, Lieutenant Richard Collins, and John
Carmichael, two serjeants, forty-four rank and file
wounded; one drummer and eight private soldiers
missing.</p>

<p>The regiment was engaged in the subsequent operations
for the reduction of the island, which was accomplished
before the end of May; and the Royal authority
was given for the word "<span class="smcap">St. Lucia</span>" to be borne on
the colours of the regiment, to commemorate its distinguished
conduct on this service.</p>

<p>After the reduction of St. Lucia, the regiment was
embarked for St. Vincent, where an insurrection had
broken out, and the native Caribs and many French
colonists were in arms against the British authority.
The insurgents were speedily overcome, and the Caribs
fled to the woods. The hostile spirit which these
people had long shown towards the British interests,
occasioned the government to resolve to remove them
from the island. The measures for this purpose were
attended with much harassing duty to the troops, and
many skirmishes occurred; but the Caribs were eventually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
forced to submit. The regiment was afterwards
withdrawn from the island, when it received the following
communication from Major-General Peter Hunter,
dated 26th November, 1796:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I beg you, and the officers and soldiers of the
<span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment, under your command, will
accept of my best thanks for the zeal, activity, and
humanity which have been testified by you and them,
on all occasions, while under my command, during
the brigand and Caribbee war in the island of St.
Vincent. I am also requested by the Council and
Assembly of the island to communicate, not only to
the officers and soldiers now serving in St. Vincent,
but to all those whom I have had the honor to command
since my arrival here, the sentiments that the
Assembly and inhabitants of this colony entertain of
the good conduct and behaviour of the troops, and to
offer their warmest, most grateful, and unfeigned
thanks for the eminent services the army has rendered
this island."</p>

<p>Major-General Lake having been removed to the
seventy-third regiment, he was succeeded in the
colonelcy of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> by Major-General Welbore
Ellis Doyle, by commission dated the 2nd of November,
1796.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1797</div>

<p>Spain having united with France in hostility to
Great Britain, the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> were employed in an
expedition against the Spanish settlement of <em>Trinidad</em>,
which was captured in February, 1797, without loss.</p>

<p>The army subsequently proceeded against <em>Porto
Rico</em>, and a landing was effected on the 18th of April;
but the expedition proved of insufficient strength for
the capture of this place, and the troops re-embarked on
the night of the 30th of April. The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
three rank and file killed; Captain John Rhind and
three men wounded; Captain Samuel Dover taken
prisoner. The regiment returned to St. Vincent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1798</div>

<p>On the death of Major-General Doyle, the colonelcy
was conferred on Lieut.-General Charles Crosbie, from
the late Royal Dublin regiment, his commission bearing
date the 3rd of January, 1798.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1799<br />1800</div>

<p>After remaining at St. Vincent during the years
1798 and 1799, the regiment was removed to St.
Lucia in 1800.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1802</div>

<p>At the peace of Amiens, in 1802, the island of St.
Lucia was restored to France, when the regiment returned
to England, much reduced in numbers by the
climate of the West Indies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p>On the arrival of the regiment in England, the men
enlisted for limited service were discharged at Hilsea
barracks, and in January, 1803, it marched, under the
command of Lieut.-Colonel Lightburne, for Shrewsbury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<p>The first battalion, having been completed to eight
hundred rank and file, embarked at Portsmouth, on
the 20th of April, 1805, for the East Indies, under the
orders of Lieut.-Colonel Sebright Mawby. The fleet
sailed under the convoy of His Majesty's ship "Blenheim,"
on the 24th of April: in the early part of
August it encountered a French line-of-battle ship and
a frigate, when some firing took place, but nothing
serious occurred; and on the 23rd of that month it
arrived in Madras roads, when the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> landed,
and marched into Fort St. George, where they lost a
very promising officer, Captain Henry Knight Erskine,
whose death was much regretted. In October they
proceeded in boats to the fertile district of Dinapore,
on the right bank of the Ganges, and occupied that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
station, in the midst of a country abounding with grain,
cattle, and sheep.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>In consequence of the unhealthy state of the
battalion, it was withdrawn from Dinapore, when
Major-General Clarke expressed, in orders, his approbation
of its conduct while under his command,
and the high sense he entertained of the zeal and abilities
of Lieut.-Colonel Mawby and of the officers generally.
It arrived at Berhampore, a considerable station
on the left bank of the Hoogly river, on the 6th of July.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807</div>

<p>General Crosbie having died, the colonelcy was conferred
on Major-General the Honorable John Abercromby,
by commission dated the 21st of March, 1807,
the sixth anniversary of the battle of Alexandria.</p>

<p>In September the first battalion embarked in boats
to proceed up the Ganges, when Major-General
Palmer recorded, in orders, his approbation of its
exemplary conduct while stationed at Berhampore.
After a voyage of eleven weeks in boats up the river,
the battalion landed at Cawnpore on the 29th of November,
and marched into the spacious barracks on an
elevated site at that place.</p>

<p>The gallant conduct of two serjeants and fourteen
private soldiers of the first battalion on board of the
Company's ship Fame, when it was captured by a
French frigate (the Piedmontaise), was rewarded by a
donation from the Court of Directors, of 5<em>l.</em> to each of
the serjeants, and 4<em>l.</em> to each private soldier.</p>

<p>The first battalion was stationed at Cawnpore during
the year, and was highly commended in orders for its
correct discipline and excellent conduct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>On the 19th of January, 1809, three companies were
detached, under Captain Piercy, to the province of
Bundelcund, and joining the troops under Lieut.-Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Martindell, were employed in reducing some
refractory native Sirdars. These companies were at
the siege and capture of the fort of <em>Adjighion</em>, situate
upon a lofty mountain; and after the surrender of this
place they rejoined the regiment, which took the field
in November, and joined a numerous division under
Lieut.-Colonel Martindell. This body of troops was
called out in consequence of signs of defection in the
native Madras army, and it performed many long and
difficult marches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>The first battalion continued in the field until
March, 1810, when it returned to Cawnpore. Lieut.-Colonel
Mawby, the officers and soldiers, received
the thanks of the Commander of the field force for their
excellent conduct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>During the year 1811 the first battalion remained
at Cawnpore, where Lieut.-Colonel Buckland assumed
the command.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>Five companies of the first battalion proceeded
from their quarters at Cawnpore to take part with
the division under Colonel Martindell, in the reduction
of the strong fortress of <em>Callinger</em>, before
which place the troops arrived on the 19th of January,
1812. A breach having been reported practicable,
the fortress was assaulted on the 2nd of February.
A serjeant and twelve privates of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
regiment formed the forlorn-hope, which led the
assault of the breach; they were followed by the
grenadiers and light infantry of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>,
under Captain Fraser, supported by the remaining
three companies of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>, and the grenadiers
and light infantry of the native regiments. The fortress
of Callinger is situated upon a high rock of difficult
access and great extent, in one of the ranges of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
mountains in the province of Allahabad; and when that
portion of the country was ceded to the British, this
strong fortress, which had resisted native armies,
became the asylum of the disaffected and of the
banditti of the province. These desperate characters
crowded the breach as the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> rushed forward
to storm the works. Select marksmen of the garrison
were supplied with loaded muskets by other men
as fast as they could fire them, and huge stones were
in readiness to be thrown upon the assailants. The
signal being given, the storming party, under the
orders of Lieut.-Colonel Sebright Mawby and the
officers and soldiers of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>, made a gallant
effort to gain the breach; ladders were placed
against the rock and the men ascended with enthusiastic
ardour; but showers of huge stones and
a storm of musketry destroyed every man who gained
the top of the rock; at the same time it was found
impracticable to get other ladders fixed to communicate
with a second small projection of the rock which appeared
in the breach; under these circumstances the
storming party was ordered to retire. The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
had Captain Fraser, Lieutenant and Adjutant
Nice, one serjeant, one corporal, and ten private
soldiers killed; Captain Cuppage, Lieutenants Stone,
Young, Stewart, Daly, Cruice, Davis, and Booth, and
one hundred and twenty soldiers wounded; several
men died of their wounds.</p>

<p>In regimental orders issued on the 3rd of February,
it was stated:&mdash;"Lieut.-Colonel Mawby has not words
to express his admiration of the conduct of every
officer and soldier of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> in the storm of
yesterday; anything he could say on the occasion
would fall very short of what they deserved, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
greater bravery and perseverance never were displayed
by men, and had it been possible to have
carried the breach, their bravery would have done
it. His feelings for the severe loss sustained by the
regiment may be imagined, but cannot be expressed;
it is, however, a great consolation to know that the
whole army before Callinger speaks of their bravery
in terms of the highest commendation."</p>

<p>The conduct of the storming party was also commended
in orders by Colonel Martindell, who stated,&mdash;"If
the difficulties which they had to surmount had
been found of a nature to be overcome, the persevering
energy and undaunted courage of the troops,
so very admirably conspicuous, would have been
crowned with that success, which their animated
exertions, and steady cool bravery, so eminently
deserved."</p>

<p>In general orders by the government it was stated,
"His Lordship in Council cordially unites in the sentiments
of admiration expressed by His Excellency
the Commander-in-Chief, of the exemplary exertions,
zeal, and persevering courage manifested by Lieut.-Colonel
Mawby, <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment, and the
brave officers and men acting under his command."</p>

<p>Lieut.-Colonel Mawby particularly reported the gallant
conduct of Serjeant-Major Thomas Clarke, of the
<span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment.</p>

<p>In consequence of the difficulty experienced in the
reduction of Callinger, Major Piercy, who commanded
the five companies of the regiment left at Cawnpore,
received orders to proceed as rapidly as possible to
join the besieging army; but before he arrived, the
garrison had surrendered. The cool determined
bravery of the officers and soldiers of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
at the storming of the breach, had produced a great
impression on the defenders of the fortress, who
declared to their commander, that they would not
stand a second assault: the Killedar, therefore, was
forced to capitulate and deliver up the fortress.</p>

<p>The regiment afterwards returned to Cawnpore,
where its appearance and discipline elicited the commendations
of the Commander-in-Chief in India at a
review in September of this year. In October the
regiment marched to Meerut on the north-west frontier.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1813</div>

<p>During the year 1813 the first battalion was
stationed at Meerut.</p>

<p>In the meantime circumstances had occurred which
occasioned the battalion to be called from its
quarters at Meerut, to take the field against
the Nepaulese, whose depredations on the British
territory could not be restrained without force of arms.
The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> marched from Meerut on the 14th of
October, and joined the division of the army appointed
to invade the kingdom of Nepaul, or the Gorca state,
under the orders of Major-General Robert Rollo
Gillespie. This division was directed to penetrate the
Himalaya mountains by the pass of the Deyrah Doon,
and capture the strong fort of <em>Kalunga</em>, situate upon a
peak in the mountains between the rivers Sutlej
and Ganges, which was defended by a garrison of
warlike mountaineers, under a celebrated Hindoo
warrior named Bulbudder.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>Two companies of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>, commanded by
Lieutenant Young, were detached with a small column
under Lieut.-Colonel Carpenter of the seventeenth
native infantry, and ascending the Timlee pass, into
the Deyrah valley, joined at midnight on the 24th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
October, another detachment under Colonel Mawby of
the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment, who advanced to capture
the fort of <em>Kalunga</em> by a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup-de-main</i>; but upon approaching
the place, it was found to be a strong work
of excellent stone masonry, more formidable than it
had been represented to be, and not to be taken
without cannon. After a close reconnoissance, Colonel
Mawby retired, and received the acknowledgments of
Major-General Gillespie, in orders, for his conduct on
the occasion. The Major-General afterwards advanced
with the leading corps, and taking with him a few
light field-pieces on the backs of elephants, had them
placed in battery upon a piece of table-land near the
fort, and on the morning of the 31st of October storming
parties were in readiness to attack the fort. The
troops moved forward with great gallantry, but under
such unfavourable circumstances, that the assault
failed; among the other disasters the pioneers bearing
the ladders fell, from the fire of the garrison, in the
midst of a village of grass huts, which caught fire, and
the storming party was thus deprived of the means for
ascending the walls of the fort. The two companies of
the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> lost several men, and had Lieutenants
Young and Anstice severely wounded. Three of the
columns of attack had not advanced, in consequence of
not hearing, or not understanding, the signal, and the
messengers despatched to them never reached their
destination. The columns which had advanced, withdrew
to the village. At this moment three companies
of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> arrived from a long march, under
Captain Wheeler Coultman, and were ordered to join
the storming party, which consisted also of a brigade of
Bengal horse artillery (six-pounders), under the command
of Captain Charles Pratt Kennedy, for the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of making another determined effort to capture
the place. Major-General Gillespie headed the assault
in person. A party of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> dragged two
of the guns forward with ropes up a steep ascent under
a sharp fire, and after overcoming the difficulty of a
stockade across the path, a few shots were fired at a
small gate in the wall, to force it open. A destructive
fire was opened from the walls upon the storming
party, crowded in a narrow space, waiting for the gate
to be forced open and a passage to be made; Major-General
Gillespie placed himself at the head of the
troops, and while leading the men to the assault, he
fell mortally wounded. The attack failed; the
storming party retired; and afterwards withdrew from
before the fort to await the arrival of a battering
train. The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> had sixteen men killed and
seventy-five wounded.</p>

<p>The battering train having arrived from Delhi, the
siege was resumed by the troops under Colonel Mawby,
and on the 27th of November the flank companies
of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>, with one battalion company of the
regiment, and the grenadiers of the native corps,
stormed the breach under the orders of Major William
Ingleby of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>. A numerous body of
mountaineers defended the breach with desperate resolution.
Major Ingleby was wounded, and withdrew,
leaving the storming party under Captain Coultman.
Lieutenant Harrington and a few men of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
ascended the breach, but were instantly killed.
The storming party proving not sufficiently numerous
to capture the place, the remaining companies of the
regiment were ordered forward, and the attack was
repeated, but without success: the approach to the
breach proved very difficult, and the defenders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
numerous and desperate; after a severe loss had been
sustained, the storming party was ordered to retire.
Lieutenant Harrington and twenty men of the regiment
were killed on this occasion; Major Ingleby, Captain
Stone, Lieutenants Horsley, Green, and Brodie, Ensign
Aufrere, twelve serjeants, three drummers, and one
hundred and eighty-four rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>The battery resumed its fire to widen the breach;
but further loss was prevented by the garrison evacuating
the fort, and retreating and forcing their way
through the besieging corps.</p>

<p>From Kalunga the division moved along a ridge of
mountains towards <em>Nahn</em>; the enemy evacuating the
fortifications as the British approached, and retiring
to another ridge of mountains of much greater elevation.
On the 27th of December the flank companies
of the regiment were engaged in driving back the
enemy's outposts, in order to make lodgments for besieging
some fortified places on the Jampta heights,
and had one serjeant and eight rank and file killed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;This Sidenote was missing in the original text">1815</ins></div>

<p>In 1815 the Nepaulese were brought to submission,
and the regiment marched from the camp in the mountains
to the banks of the Ganges, where it embarked in
boats and proceeded down the river to Berhampore,
where it landed on the 30th of August, and was joined
by a strong detachment from the second battalion, under
the command of Major Giles. On the 20th of October
the regiment again embarked in boats, and proceeded
to Calcutta, where it remained until December, when
it embarked for Madras.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1816</div>

<p>In January, 1816, the first battalion marched from
Madras to Wallajahbad; but in March three companies
returned to Madras, and seven proceeded to
the Naggery Pass, to keep in check the plundering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
bands of <em>Pindarees</em>, who infested the British territory
in India at this period. These marauding tribes
having been driven from British India with severe
loss, the seven companies marched to Bangalore, where
they were joined by the detachment from Madras in
June; also by a detachment from Europe. In November
the battalion commenced its march for Trichinopoly,
where it arrived on the 12th of December, after
a march of two hundred and seven miles.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817</div>

<p>On the 14th of February, 1817, Lieut.-General Sir
John Abercromby, G.C.B., died at Marseilles, in the
south of France, at which place he had resided some
time for the benefit of his health. The high military
character and private virtues of this distinguished officer,
with his attachment to, and the lively interest he
took in every thing connected with, the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
regiment, occasioned his death to be much regretted.
He was succeeded by Lieut.-General Rowland Lord
Hill, G.C.B., from the ninety-fourth regiment.</p>

<p>Colonel Mawby commanded the regiment in cantonments
at Trichinopoly; and in June the flank companies
were detached, under the command of Major
Giles, to join a flank battalion forming at Darwah, to
serve with a division of the army under Colonel Pritzler,
which was called to take the field in consequence of
several native chiefs having prepared to wage war
against the British power in India.</p>

<p>While the flank companies were in the field, the
strength of the regiment was augmented by the detachment
from the second battalion, and a number of
volunteers from the eightieth regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1818</div>

<p>In 1818 the regiment sustained great loss from the
cholera.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1819</div>

<p>The flank companies were actively employed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the field force under Brigadier-General Pritzler, who
reduced several fortified places to submission to the
British authority, and among others the fort of <em>Copaul
Droog</em>, the garrison of which place made a desperate
defence. The excellent conduct of the troops employed
in this service was made known in general orders dated
the 22nd of June, 1819. The flank battalion led the
assault of the place; and the conduct of Captain Cuppage,
and Lieutenant Silver of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
regiment, was particularly noticed. Lieutenant Silver
was wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1820</div>

<p>Leaving Trichinopoly in January, 1820, the regiment
commenced its march for Bellary, a distance of about
three hundred and ninety miles, under the orders of
Colonel Mawby. The cholera broke out in the regiment
on the march, and it lost a highly esteemed officer,
Lieut.-Colonel Fehrszen, who had distinguished
himself while serving with the second battalion in
Spain and the south of France; he was buried with
military honours at Salem. Lieutenant George FitzGerald,
who had also served with reputation in the
Peninsular War, died a few days afterwards, and was
buried at Nimdydroog. While passing through the
Mysore, the cholera disappeared; and on the 25th of
February the regiment arrived at Bellary; having lost
two officers and eighteen soldiers on the march.</p>

<p>Colonel Mawby having been promoted to the rank
of major-general, the command of the regiment devolved
on Lieut.-Colonel Mansel.</p>

<p>After halting at Bellary five months, the regiment
commenced its march for Bangalore, where it arrived
on the 1st of August. Lieutenant John Wilton, a gallant
and meritorious officer, died on the 28th of
August, much regretted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>The flank battalion, under Major Giles, had continued
to perform much arduous and valuable service,
under Brigadier-General Pritzler; but the necessity
for its continuing in the field having ceased, the
several companies marched to join their respective
regiments. The companies of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> arrived
at head-quarters on the 30th of November. The
gallant, zealous, and exemplary conduct of these companies,
during the three years and a half which they
had been employed on field service, was highly commended
in orders. The regiment was at this period
commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Edward Carey Fleming.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1821</div>

<p>Major John Giles, who had commanded the flank battalion
on field service with reputation, died on the 2nd
of May, 1821, at Cannanore. Quarter-master Robert
Blackie died soon afterwards; he had risen by merit
from the ranks of the regiment, and had held the commission
of quarter-master nineteen years: he was
much respected in the regiment.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1822</div>

<p>In May, 1822, the regiment quitted the Mysore,
having first received the thanks of Lieut.-General
Bowser, in division orders, for its exemplary conduct,
and proceeded to Fort St. George, where it arrived
on the 5th of June; having lost, on this march of
two hundred miles, fifteen men by cholera. Major
Wheeler Coultman also died on the 22nd of May.</p>

<p>The forty-first regiment arriving from England in
July, the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> marched out of Fort St.
George and encamped at a village on the Poonamallee
Road, and were placed under orders for embarkation
for England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1823</div>

<p>Seven hundred and fifty-six non-commissioned officers
and soldiers volunteered to transfer their services
to other corps, and to remain in India; twenty-one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
old soldiers were placed on the out-pension of Chelsea
Hospital, and permitted to reside in India; and the
regiment embarked from Madras on the 9th of March,
1823, after a service of eighteen years in India.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> It
landed at Gravesend on the 8th of July, and marched
to Chatham, where it halted a few days, and afterwards
proceeded to Hilsea barracks. It was subsequently
removed to Weedon barracks, and active measures
were adopted for recruiting its numbers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1825<br />1826</div>

<p>In 1825 the regiment proceeded to Chatham, and
afterwards to Portsmouth, where it was inspected and
reviewed by its colonel, General Lord Hill, in May,
1826, and elicited his Lordship's approbation. It afterwards
marched into Lancashire, and in October embarked
at Liverpool for Ireland: it landed at Dublin,
and marched from thence to Templemore.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1827</div>

<p>Leaving Templemore in the spring of 1827, the
regiment proceeded to Cork; and in the autumn the
head-quarters were removed to Kilkenny.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1828<br />1829</div>

<p>In April, 1828, the regiment marched to Dublin;
and in the spring of 1829 to Birr, where it was formed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
into <em>six service and four reserve companies</em>, preparatory
to the former proceeding to a foreign station.</p>

<p>The service companies proceeded to Cork, where
they embarked on the 2nd of November for Gibraltar,
and arrived at that important fortress in December.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1830</div>

<p>A pair of new colours bearing the words "<span class="smcap">Nieuport</span>,"
"<span class="smcap">Tournay</span>," "<span class="smcap">St. Lucia</span>," "<span class="smcap">Talavera</span>,"
"<span class="smcap">Salamanca</span>," "<span class="smcap">Vittoria</span>," "<span class="smcap">Pyrenees</span>," "<span class="smcap">Nivelle</span>,"
"<span class="smcap">Toulouse</span>," and "<span class="smcap">Peninsula</span>," having been received,
the regiment was formed on parade on the 12th
of January, 1830, under Lieut.-Colonel James Considine's
command; the colours were consecrated by the
Rev. J. S. Pering, the garrison Chaplain; they were
then handed by the Lieut.-Governor, Sir George Don,
to Mrs. Considine, who presented them to the regiment,
with a suitable address. The day was concluded by
a supper and ball, given by the officers of the regiment,
to which the officers in garrison, and the principal
inhabitants of the place, were invited. The soldiers
were treated with a dinner and a hogshead of wine
on the following day; and on the 14th, the serjeants
were permitted to treat their friends to a supper and
a dance in one of the large store-rooms, which was
fitted up for the occasion.</p>

<p>The reserve companies remained in Ireland until
May of this year, when they embarked at Dublin,
for Liverpool.</p>

<p>In November, 1830, General Lord Hill, G.C.B.,
G.C.H., K.C., was removed to the Royal regiment of
Horse Guards, and was succeeded in the colonelcy
of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> by Major-General Lord FitzRoy
James Henry Somerset, K.C.B.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1834<br />1835</div>

<p>The service companies remained on duty at Gibraltar
until March, 1834, when they proceeded to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
island of Malta, where they remained during the year
1835; in October the depôt companies returned to
Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1836</div>

<p>In the summer of 1836 the service companies
embarked at Malta for the Ionian Islands, and
landed at Corfu in July.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1840</div>

<p>After remaining nearly four years in the Ionian
Islands, the service companies embarked at Corfu
on the 28th of April, 1840, for England, and landed
on the 9th of June at Plymouth, where they were joined
by the depôt companies from Ireland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1841</div>

<p>The regiment remained at Plymouth until July,
1841, when it embarked for Scotland, and marching
to Edinburgh, was stationed in the castle of that city
during the year 1842.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1843</div>

<p>In April, 1843, the regiment proceeded from Edinburgh
to Ireland, and was stationed at Belfast until
September, when it marched to Enniskillen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1844</div>

<p>The regiment marched from Enniskillen to Newry
in January, 1844, and having been selected to proceed
to India, the usual augmentation was made to its numbers.
It proceeded to Manchester in July, and embarked
at Liverpool for Bengal on the 20th of August
under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Harry
Shakespear Phillips, arriving at Calcutta on the 30th
of December following.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1845</div>

<p>On the 22nd of January, 1845, the regiment proceeded
from Chinsurah to Cawnpore, where it arrived on the
19th of March; in October it marched to Agra, and on
the 19th of December to Delhi, where it arrived and
encamped on the 28th of December, 1845.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1846</div>

<p>During the brief period which elapsed between the
11th and 23rd of December, 1845, the valley of the
<em>Sutlej</em> was the scene of active and interesting operations;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the frontier of the Punjaub<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> (<em>punj</em>, five, and <em>aub</em>,
waters) had been crossed by a numerous and well disciplined
Sikh army; and the enemy had been repulsed
in two sanguinary battles, at <em>Moodkee</em> on the 18th of
December, and at <em>Ferozeshah</em> three days afterwards.</p>

<p>After these successes, it was determined by the
Commander-in-Chief in India to rest the main body of
the army until strong reinforcements arrived, when a
grand attack was to be made on the Sikhs, who had
employed the interval in strengthening the position
they had taken up on the British side of the river
Sutlej, the boundary of the Punjaub from India.</p>

<p>Reinforcements accordingly proceeded to the frontier,
and the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> was one of the regiments
ordered to join the Army of the Sutlej. The regiment,
under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Harry
Shakespear Phillips, marched from Delhi on the 5th of
January, 1846, and arrived at Kurnaul on the 10th of
that month: two days afterwards the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
marched to join the portion of the army detached under
the command of Major-General Sir Harry Smith, who
was proceeding to the relief of Loodianah (celebrated
for its manufacture of imitative Cashmere shawls),
which was threatened by a force of twenty thousand
Sikhs under the command of Runjoor Singh. The
junction was effected on the 21st of January, on which
day the regiment suffered severely from the heavy fire
of the enemy's artillery on the march to Loodianah,
sustaining a loss of thirty-six men killed. Major-General
Sir Harry Smith, by a series of skilful movements,
avoided a regular engagement, and effected his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
communication with Loodianah, but not without severe
loss. On the 28th of January the Major-General
determined to attack the Sikhs under Runjoor Singh
in their strong position at <em>Aliwal</em>, and the result was a
splendid victory. Runjoor Singh's camp, with all his
baggage, ammunition, and stores, fell into the hands
of the victors, and the left wing of the Sikh army was
thus almost completely disorganised.</p>

<p>Her Majesty's <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>, and the thirtieth native
infantry, formed the third brigade, under Brigadier
Wilson, and were opposed upon the left to the "<em>Aieen</em>"
troops, called <em>Avitabiles</em>,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> when the conflict was fiercely
raging. The enemy, driven back on his left and centre,
endeavoured to hold his right to cover the passage
of the river, and strongly occupied the village of
Bhoondree, which was carried by the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> at
the point of the bayonet: the regiment then moved
forward, in support of the thirtieth native infantry, by
the right of the village.</p>

<p>After expressing his thanks to Lieut.-Colonel
Phillips of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment, Major-General
Sir Harry Smith added in his official despatch:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>
<p>"I have only to report upon Her Majesty's <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>,
a young regiment, but veterans in daring
gallantry and regularity; and Lieut.-Colonel Phillips's
bravery and coolness attracted the attention of
myself and every staff-officer I sent to him."</p>

<p>The casualties of the regiment were limited to three
men killed and eight wounded.</p>

<p>Although the Sikh army was much disheartened at
the sight of the numerous bodies which floated from
the battle-field to the bridge of boats at Sobraon, yet
in a few days they appeared as confident as ever of
being able to retain their entrenched position, and to
prevent the passage of the river.</p>

<p>On the 3rd of February the regiment marched
from Aliwal, and joined the head-quarters of the
Army of the Sutlej on the 8th of that month.</p>

<p>The heavy ordnance having arrived, the Commander-in-Chief
resolved to storm the formidable entrenchments
of the Sikhs at <em>Sobraon</em>, and finally expel them
from the territory they had invaded. This was an
undertaking of some magnitude. It was ascertained
that the entrenchments were defended by thirty
thousand of their bravest troops; besides being united
by a good bridge to a reserve on the opposite bank of
the river, on which was stationed a considerable camp,
with artillery, which commanded and flanked their
field-works on the British side of the Sutlej.</p>

<p>On the 10th of February the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> formed
part of the attacking division, on the extreme left of
the army, under the command of Major-General Sir
Robert Dick. It had been intended that the cannonade
should have commenced at daybreak, but the
heavy mist, which hung over the field and river,
rendered it necessary to delay operations until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
sun's rays had cleared the atmosphere. Meanwhile,
on the margin of the Sutlej, two brigades of Major-General
Sir Robert Dick's division, under his personal
command, stood ready to commence the assault against
the extreme right of the Sikhs. His seventh brigade,
in which was the tenth foot, reinforced by the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
regiment, and led by Brigadier Stacy, was to
head the attack, supported at two hundred yards
distance by the sixth brigade under Brigadier Wilkinson.</p>

<p>The part the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> sustained in the conflict
cannot be better expressed than in the words of the
despatch of the Commander-in-Chief, General Sir
Hugh Gough:&mdash;</p>

<p>"At nine o'clock, Brigadier Stacy's brigade, supported
on either flank by Captains Horseford's and
Fordyce's batteries, and Lieut.-Colonel Lane's troop
of horse artillery, moved to the attack in admirable
order. The infantry and guns aided each other
correlatively. The former marched steadily on in
line, which they halted only to correct when necessary.
The latter took up successive positions at the gallop,
until at length they were within three hundred
yards of the heavy batteries of the Sikhs; but notwithstanding
the regularity and coolness, and scientific
character of this assault, which Brigadier Wilkinson
well supported, so hot was the fire of cannon,
musketry, and zumboorucks kept up by the Khalsa
troops, that it seemed for some moments impossible
that the entrenchments could be won under it; but
soon persevering gallantry triumphed, and the whole
army had the satisfaction to see the gallant Brigadier
Stacy's soldiers driving the Sikhs in confusion
before them within the area of their encampment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
The tenth foot, under Lieut.-Colonel Franks, now
for the first time brought into serious contact with
the enemy, greatly distinguished themselves. This
regiment never fired a shot until it had got within
the works of the enemy. <em>The onset of Her Majesty's</em>
<span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> <em>was as gallant and effective</em>. The forty-third
and fifty-ninth native infantry, brigaded with
them, emulated both in cool determination."</p>

<p>Allusion was also made to the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> in the
General Order of the 14th of February, by the Right
Honorable the Governor-General of India, in which
it was stated:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Her Majesty's tenth, <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>, and eightieth
regiments, with the thirty-third, forty-third, fifty-ninth,
and sixty-third native infantry, moving at a
firm and steady pace, <em>never fired a shot till they had
passed the barriers opposed to them</em>, a forbearance
much to be commended, and most worthy of constant
imitation, to which may be attributed <em>the success of
their effort, and the small loss they sustained</em>."</p>

<p>The first success was gallantly seconded by the remainder
of the army, and by eleven o'clock, after a
severe hand-to-hand conflict, the <em>Battle of Sobraon</em> was
gained. A sudden rise of the Sutlej rendered the
river hardly fordable, and added to the loss of the Sikhs'
numbers of whom were drowned in attempting the
passage. Sixty-seven pieces of cannon, upwards of
two hundred camel-swivels (zumboorucks), numerous
standards, and vast munitions of war were the trophies
of the victory.</p>

<p>Captain Charles Edward Dawson Warren, and
eight rank and file of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment, were
killed. Lieutenant-Colonel William George Gold,
Captain Thomas Smart, Lieutenants John Chester,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Anthony B. O. Stokes, Robert Nathaniel Clarke, and
John Breton, Ensigns Henry Lucas and William
Dunning (Adjutant) were wounded. Captain Smart
and Lieutenant Clarke died in a few days of their
wounds. Lieutenant Dunning, who was promoted
after the battle, also died of his wound on the 6th of
April following. One serjeant and one hundred and
four rank and file were wounded.</p>

<p>Medals were struck for the victories of <em>Aliwal</em> and
<em>Sobraon</em>, and were presented by the Government of
India to the regiments present in those battles.</p>

<p>Her Majesty has been graciously pleased to authorize
the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment to bear on its colours and
appointments the words "<span class="smcap">Aliwal</span>" and "<span class="smcap">Sobraon</span>," to
commemorate its gallantry in those victories.</p>

<p>The Battle of Sobraon concluded a campaign of
unexampled rapidity, and the youthful Sovereign of
Lahore, Maha Rajah Dhuleep Singh, was compelled to
wait upon the Right Honorable the Governor-General,
Sir Henry Hardinge, and express contrition for
the offences of his army for the unjust and unprovoked
invasion of the British territories. The Maha Rajah
was afterwards conducted to his capital by the British
troops, who formally took possession of the citadel of
Lahore. In less than two months, four important victories
had been gained on a line of country about sixty
miles in length, under most trying circumstances, over
a great and warlike people, possessed of military skill
of no common order, with all the appliances of war,
which will ever render the campaign one of the most
remarkable in the History of India, a campaign in
which the Governor-General, Sir Henry (now Viscount)
Hardinge, was present in the several actions, volunteering
to act as second in command, that he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
aid the admirable strategy of the Commander-in-chief
General Sir Hugh (now Lord) Gough, by his presence
and military experience.</p>

<p>The regiment marched from Sobraon on the 11th of
February, forming part of the advance guard of the
army proceeding to Lahore, where it arrived on the
13th of that month, and encamped outside its walls
until the 22nd of March, when the regiment received
orders to march for Umballa, which it commenced on
the following day, arriving there and entering the cantonments
on the 8th of April, 1846.</p>

<p>On the 15th of October, 1846, the regiment proceeded
to Ferozepore, and arrived there on the 28th of
that month.</p>

<div class="sidenotex">1847</div>

<p>The regiment remained in cantonments at Ferozepore
during the year 1847.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1848</div>

<p>On the 21st of February, 1848, the regiment returned
to Lahore, where it was stationed in December, 1848,
to which period this record of the services of the regiment
is brought.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1803</div>

<p class="noindent">A short interval from war was ceded to Europe by
the peace of Amiens, and during that period the First
Consul of France, Napoleon Bonaparte, was secretly
making hostile preparations for accomplishing his
ambitious purposes; he assumed the position of a
dictator to Europe, and when the British government
refused to submit to his domination, he assembled
an army for the invasion of England, that he might,
by one mighty effort, destroy the power of the
British people, who appeared as a barrier to his
schemes of aggrandizement. The spirit of the nation
was aroused by the menace of invasion; patriotic enthusiasm
pervaded all ranks; and the "<em>Army of Reserve
Act</em>" having been passed for raising men for
home service by ballot, the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment
marched into Yorkshire to receive part of the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
raised in that extensive county. The numbers received
being considerable, a second battalion was added to
the establishment in October, 1803, and was formed at
Sunderland under the superintendence of Lieut.-Colonel
Scrogs; it speedily mustered one thousand
rank and file.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1804</div>

<p>A number of the men, raised under the provision of
the Army of Reserve Act, having voluntarily extended
their services, they were added to the first battalion
in February, 1804; the others, being only liable to
serve in the United Kingdom, remained in the second
battalion, which embarked from Whitehaven for Dublin,
where it arrived on the 3rd of March, under the orders
of Lieut.-Colonel Lightburn. In August it encamped
on the Curragh of Kildare, and in September returned
to Dublin.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1805</div>

<p>The battalion was conspicuous for its good conduct
while at Dublin; in July of this year it
marched to Galway, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Bingham. The Commander-in-Chief in Ireland,
Lieut.-General Lord Cathcart, proceeding with a body
of troops to Hanover, he was so highly esteemed by
the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>, that the men solicited their commanding
officer to forward a memorial to head-quarters,
requesting permission to extend their services to the
Continent, and to accompany his Lordship. They were
thanked for their spirited offer; but the circumstances
of the service did not require their presence on the
Continent at this period. During the winter the battalion
marched to Limerick.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1806</div>

<p>In March, 1806, the head-quarters were removed to
Rathkeale: in April two hundred men proceeded to join
the first battalion in India: they were followed by a
further number of three hundred in October: as this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
detachment was proceeding to the Isle of Wight, one
transport was boarded by a French privateer; the soldiers
were without arms, otherwise they could have
overpowered their enemies: Captain Classen and sixty-five
men were taken to France, where the captain died.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1807</div>

<p>During the winter of 1807 the limited-service men
of the second battalion were transferred to a garrison
battalion, which greatly reduced its numbers; the few
remaining men marched to Dublin in January, 1807,
embarked from thence for Liverpool, and afterward
proceeded to Shrewsbury.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1808</div>

<p>The second battalion proceeded from Shrewsbury to
Weymouth, where it arrived in October, and was joined
by a number of volunteers from the militia.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1808 the second battalion marched to
Bletchington; in May was removed to Portsmouth,
where it embarked for Ireland, and after landing at Cork,
it proceeded from thence to Limerick, and in the autumn
to Fermoy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1809</div>

<p>At this period the second battalion received orders
to proceed from Ireland, to take part in the
deliverance of the Peninsula from the power of
Napoleon, Emperor of France, whose attempts to
subvert the liberties of Europe were strenuously
opposed by Great Britain. The battalion embarked
at Cork on the 12th of March, landed in Portugal,
at a small town opposite Lisbon, on the 6th of April;
and proceeded up the river Tagus in boats a few days
afterwards to Villa Franca, from whence it marched to
Rio Mayor. The seventh Royal fusiliers, and the
<span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>, were formed in brigade under Brigadier-General
A. Campbell; and the officers and soldiers were
highly gratified by the arrival of Lieut.-General Sir
Arthur Wellesley to assume the command of the army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> had the honor of taking part in
the operations by which the French army under
Marshal Soult was driven from <em>Oporto</em>: they were
not engaged in forcing the passage of the Douro on
the 12th of May; they had completed a short march
and were going into billets at Cavalhos, when the order
to advance arrived, and the soldiers evinced their
ardour by cheerfully performing a long march at double
quick time, and they were speedily across the river;
but the action had ceased, and they went into quarters
in the city of Oporto, after a march of twenty-eight miles.</p>

<p>After taking part in the pursuit of the French
army through mountainous districts to the confines of
Portugal, the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> retired to Oporto, where
they halted one day; they afterwards proceeded to
Coimbra, and in the early part of June to Abrantes.</p>

<p>Advancing into Spain, the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> shared in
the operations which preceded the battle of <em>Talavera</em>,
and suffered, in common with other corps, great privation
from the want of supplies, the soldiers having no
food, on many occasions, excepting corn gathered from
the fields. In the action on the 28th of July, two
companies of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> particularly distinguished
themselves: the other companies of the battalion
were in reserve in the first instance; but they were
brought forward, and assailing one of the enemy's
columns of attack in flank, they greatly contributed
to its discomfiture and overthrow, when thirteen pieces
of artillery were captured. Sir Arthur Wellesley saw,
from a hill at a short distance, the fighting at this part
of the field, and sent twice to testify his approbation of
the conduct of the brigade. The French were repulsed
at all points; and the word "<span class="smcap">Talavera</span>," on the
colours of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment, commemorates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the gallantry of the second battalion on this occasion:
its loss was six soldiers killed; Major Kingscote, Captain
Stawell, and twenty-nine rank and file wounded.</p>

<p>The following officers were at the battle of Talavera,
on the 27th and 28th of July, 1809:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Lieut.-Colonel</em> G. R. Bingham. <em>Majors</em> W. Thursby
and N. Kingscote. <em>Captains</em> H. Parker, John Robinson,
O. G. Fehrszen, and J. L. Stawell. <em>Lieutenants</em>
J. B. Glew, Charles Ribs, F. H. Fuller, D.
Beatty, P. Hovenden, and C. Williams. <em>Ensigns</em>
Edward Barlow, George Langton, G. C. Goff, Joseph
Nicholson, J. Christie, J. J. C. Harrison, H. Brown, and
J. Devenish. <em>Adjutant</em> John Carss. <em>Surgeon</em> J. Sandall.
<em>Assistant-Surgeon</em> J. Dunn. <em>Quarter-Master</em>&mdash;Blackie.</p>

<p>The immense superiority of numbers which the
French were enabled to bring forward at this period,
prevented those decisive results following the victory
at Talavera which might have been anticipated: the
army withdrew behind the Tagus, and subsequently
occupied a position on the Guadiana river, where many
soldiers, whose strength had been exhausted by long
marches under a hot sun and a scanty supply of provisions,
died. In the autumn the battalion went into quarters
at Olivença, and in December commenced its march
across the country to Guarda in Portugal, where it
arrived on the 11th of January, 1810.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1810</div>

<p>In the beginning of March, 1810, the second battalion
was removed from Guarda to several pleasant villages
in the valley of the Mondego, where the health of the
men quickly improved. A numerous French army,
under Marshal Massena, advanced and besieged Ciudad
Rodrigo; and on the 1st of July the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> proceeded
to the Coa river, to support the light division,
observe the bridge of Castel Bom, and the ford of Juan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Miguel. The enemy, having captured Ciudad Rodrigo,
advanced in great force to invade Portugal; Lord
Wellington, not having an army sufficiently numerous
to oppose the French in the field, retired: the
<span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> fell back from the Coa upon Guarda,
and afterwards withdrew gradually before the enemy,
until it arrived at the rugged rocks of <em>Busaco</em>,
where the French legions found their advance impeded
by a formidable line of British bayonets.
The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> were detached a short distance to the
left, to observe a small mountain road which came
round that flank of the position, and during the action
on the 27th of September their post was not attacked.
The French, being unable to force the position, turned
it by a flank movement; and the British retreated to
the fortified lines of <em>Torres Vedras</em>, where they opposed
a front of battle which the French did not
venture to attack; but, after reconnoitring the lines
fell back to Santarem, where they remained during the
winter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1811</div>

<p>In Portugal the opposing armies confronted each
other until the 5th of March, when the French, having
lost many men, and being unable to procure provisions,
made a sudden retreat towards the frontiers of Portugal.
The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> followed the retreating enemy&mdash;several
skirmishes occurred; and towards the end of
March the battalion went into quarters at the hamlet
of Romilioza, in the valley of the Mondego.</p>

<p>Again advancing on the 2nd of April, the battalion
approached the river Coa on the following day, when
the French were driven from the vicinity of Sabugal.
Four days afterwards it proceeded to Castel Bom;
and on the 9th of April covered a reconnoissance, made
by Colonel Fletcher of the Royal Engineers, on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
fortress of <em>Almeida</em>, which was invested two days afterwards,
when the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> took post on the east
side of the town. They afterwards moved to San
Pedro, and furnished piquets before the fortress.</p>

<p>When Marshal Massena advanced to raise the blockade
of Almeida, the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> quitted San Pedro
and took their station in the position near <em>Fuentes d'Onor</em>.
The attacks of the enemy on the 3rd of May were repulsed;
on the 5th they were renewed, and the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
advanced to support the piquets, which were
engaged among some stone fences to the left of the
village. As it advanced, the battalion was exposed to
the fire of a French battery, but did not sustain any
loss: it took post at the foot of a hill, and supported
the piquets until the action ceased: the French being
repulsed, they afterwards retreated.</p>

<p>The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> resumed their post before Almeida;
but the French garrison contrived to destroy the works
and guns of the fortress, and to effect its escape during
the night of the 11th of May.</p>

<p>When the siege of Badajoz occasioned the advance
of Marshal Marmont with the French army to Spanish
Estremadura, the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>, and other corps left
on the Agueda, made a corresponding movement, and
joined the army under Lord Wellington in the Alemtejo.
The French armies separating again, the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
returned, with the sixth division, of which they
formed part, to the northern frontiers of Portugal. On
the 11th of September the battalion crossed the Agueda
river to the small village of Felicio Chico, to protect
the inhabitants from the depredations of the garrison
of Ciudad Rodrigo. A numerous French army advancing
to throw a supply into that fortress, the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
withdrew across the river, and proceeded to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Fuentes d'Onor; from whence they moved to the
vicinity of Espejo. The French forces advancing, the
allies, being much inferior in numbers, withdrew a few
stages; the enemy soon retired again, and the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
went into village cantonments.</p>

<p>Major-General Campbell, being appointed to the
staff of the army in India, took leave of the sixth
division, in an order dated the 5th of November, and
after expressing his thanks to the general officers commanding
brigades, and officers commanding regiments,
he adverted "to his feelings of regret at being about
to separate from that brigade which it was so long
his pride to command, and especially from the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
regiment, the only remaining corps of his
original brigade, whose undaunted steadiness and
gallantry, under the command of Lieut.-Colonel
Bingham, gained them the admiration of the army
the first time they were under fire."</p>

<div class="sidenote">1812</div>

<p>In January, 1812, when Lord Wellington besieged
and captured <em>Ciudad Rodrigo</em>, the sixth division was at
Penna Verde; but it advanced to the frontiers on the
approach of the French army: when the enemy withdrew,
the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> fell back to Grajal. They
subsequently traversed the country to Elvas, and
formed part of the covering army during the siege of
<em>Badajoz</em>, which fortress was captured by storm on the
6th of April. After taking an active part in the
operations of the covering army, the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
again marched northward, and halted at Castel de
Vide on the 2nd of May.</p>

<p>The services of the second battalion in Portugal and
Spain, had been equally meritorious with those of the
first battalion in India. After returning from Spanish
Estremadura, it reposed a short period in quarters:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
in May it moved forward to support the troops under
Lieut.-General Hill in their attack on the French
bridge at <em>Almaraz</em>, and afterwards returned to Castel
de Vide.</p>

<p>In June the army passed the Agueda river and
advanced to <em>Salamanca</em>, the French retiring upon
Toro, but leaving a body of troops in two <em>fortified
convents</em>. The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> were employed in the siege
of these convents, and on the 18th of June Lieutenant
J. H. Devenish was severely wounded in the trenches;
he died on the 24th, and was buried in the church near
the great square of the city. Marshal Marmont advancing
to relieve the besieged convents, the regiment
was twice removed from the siege to confront the
French army; but the enemy did not hazard an
attack. On the 23rd of June, when an unsuccessful
attempt was made by the light infantry to capture the
smaller convent by escalade, the regiment had three
men killed; Lieutenant James Hamilton, and seven
men, wounded. The progress of the siege was delayed
by a scarcity of ammunition, but a supply was received.
The smaller convent was captured by storm on the
27th of June; and the attack on the larger one had
commenced, when the commandant surrendered.</p>

<p>Advancing from Salamanca the army proceeded to
the banks of the Douro; but the French having been
considerably reinforced, and having crossed that river,
the allies fell back to the vicinity of Salamanca, where
the two armies manœuvred on the 22nd of July, and
the enemy, having weakened his centre in his attempt
to turn the right flank of the allied army, Lord Wellington
seized the favourable opportunity to commence
the battle. The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>, with the other corps of
the sixth division, supported the fourth division in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
its attack on the French army, and circumstances
occurred which occasioned the regiment to be brought
into action before the other corps of its division. The
<span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> supported the twenty-third Portuguese
regiment; and this corps giving way, the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
had to sustain the attack of a superior body of infantry
supported by cavalry in front, at the same time they
were exposed to the flank fire of the French posted on
one of the hills called the Arapiles. The regiment
withdrew from this unequal contest in good order, and
forming square, resisted the charge of the French
cavalry with great steadiness, thus affording an example
of what can be effected by a small body of
infantry, when charged by very superior numbers of
cavalry. The officer at the head of the French dragoons
having been wounded close to the bayonets of
the square, and the success of the attack of the other
regiments of the brigade to which the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
belonged becoming evident, the French cavalry retired,
taking with them Captain Fehrszen and nine wounded
men as prisoners. Lieut.-Colonel Bingham having
been severely wounded, the command of the regiment
devolved on Brevet Lieut.-Colonel John Mansel.</p>

<p>After resisting the charge of the French cavalry, the
<span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> again advanced, and were engaged in the
attack of the last position occupied by the enemy on
that memorable day. This was a desperate musketry
action in the dark, and the difficulties of the ascent of
the mountain gave the French division, under General
Maucune, formed on the summit, a decided advantage.
The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> were on the left of the sixth division
on this occasion, and the British gallantly won their
way upwards, and finally forced the enemy to make a
precipitate retreat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Colonel Napier has given the following spirited
description of this last attack, in his History of the
Peninsular War:&mdash;"Assisted by a brigade of the fourth
division, the troops then rushed up, and in the darkness
of the night the fire showed from afar how the
battle went. On the side of the British a sheet of
flame was seen, sometimes advancing with an even
front, sometimes pricking forth in spear heads, now
falling back in waving lines, and anon darting upwards
in one vast pyramid, the apex of which often
approached, yet never gained, the actual summit of
the mountain; but the French musketry, rapid as
lightning, sparkled along the brow of the height with
unvarying fulness, and with what desperate effects,
the dark gaps and changing shapes of the adverse
fire showed too plainly. Yet, when Pakenham had
again turned the enemy's left, and Foy's division
had glided into the forest, Maucune's task was completed,
the effulgent crest of the ridge became black
and silent, and the French army vanished, as it were,
into darkness."</p>

<p>The French army was overpowered and driven from
the field with severe loss: and the Royal authority
was afterwards given for the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment to
bear the word "<span class="smcap">Salamanca</span>" on its colours, to commemorate
the distinguished conduct of the second
battalion on this memorable occasion: Lieut.-Colonel
Bingham and Lieut.-Colonel Mansel received gold
medals.</p>

<p>Nineteen men were killed. <em>Captain</em> A. K. Blackhall
died of his wounds, much regretted; <em>Lieut.-Colonel</em>
Bingham, <em>Brevet Lieut.-Colonel</em> Robertson, <em>Captains</em>
O. G. Fehrszen, J. W. Poppleton, D. M'Dougall, and
John Fernandez, <em>Lieutenants</em> J. B. Hunter, and Joseph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Nicholson, <em>Ensign</em> Peter Bunworth, <em>Adjutant</em> John
Carss, <em>Volunteer</em> Munro Morphet, and seventy-six men
were wounded; nine men wounded and prisoners. Captain
Fehrszen was taken prisoner, but was left by the
enemy at Alba de Tormes. The total loss amounted
to nearly half the soldiers under arms on this occasion.</p>

<p>The following officers were in the field, and escaped
uninjured:&mdash;<em>Lieut.-Colonel</em> John Mansel. <em>Lieutenants</em>
P. Hovenden, and John Fraser. <em>Ensigns</em> W. Harrison,
W. Baxter, George Fitzgerald, Robert Hilliard, J. W.
Moir, and Michael Nagle. <em>Surgeon</em> T. Sandell; <em>Assistant-Surgeon</em>
Charles MacLean.</p>

<p>On the day after the battle, Major-General Hulse
was nominated to command the fifth division, when
the command of the brigade devolved on Lieut.-Colonel
Mansel of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>, and that of the second
battalion of the regiment on Lieutenant Hovenden.
In August Lieut.-Colonel Bingham was sufficiently
recovered of his wounds to resume his duty, when
he took the command of the brigade, and Lieut.-Colonel
Mansel that of the second battalion of the regiment.</p>

<p>Advancing in pursuit of the enemy, the army
entered the city of Valladolid amidst the rejoicings of
the people. The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> were afterwards left,
with the sixth division, at the small town of Cuellar,
in the province of Segovia, while Lord Wellington
advanced with the army to Madrid. General Clauzel
returning with the re-organized French army, the
sixth division withdrew to Arevalo. Lord Wellington
returning from Madrid, the French again retreated,
and the allied army advanced up the beautiful
Pisuerga and Arlanzan valleys, turning the enemy's
positions and forcing him to continue his retreat beyond
Burgos. The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> were employed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
siege of the castle of <em>Burgos</em>, in which service they had
four men killed, Ensign Nagle, one serjeant, and
several men wounded. Lieutenant Fraser distinguished
himself at the attack of one of the out-works.
The concentration of the enemy's numerous
forces having rendered a retrograde movement necessary,
the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> shared in the fatigues, privations,
and sufferings of the retreat from Burgos to the
frontiers of Portugal, where they went into winter-quarters;
they were removed from the sixth to the
fourth division, and formed in brigade with the third
battalion of the twenty-seventh, and the first battalions
of the fortieth and forty-eighth regiments, under
Major-General William Anson.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1813</div>

<p>The second battalion having become considerably
reduced in numbers by its arduous services in Spain
and Portugal, the effective and efficient soldiers were
formed into four companies, for service in the
Peninsula; and the officers of the other six companies,
with the remaining non-commissioned officers and
soldiers, were ordered to proceed to England, under
the command of Captain Poppleton. The four
service companies marched to join the head-quarters of
the fourth division, at St. Jaō de Pesquira, where
they arrived on the 6th of January, and were formed
with four companies of the second, or the Queen's
Royal, into the second provisional battalion, which was
commanded by Lieut.-Colonel Bingham of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
regiment.</p>

<p>Taking the field under a superior organization
strengthened by reinforcements, and proudly confident
in the skill and resources of its commander, the allied
army penetrated Spain in May, to turn the French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
positions on the Douro. The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> formed
part of the force under Lieut.-General Sir Thomas
Graham (afterwards Lord Lynedoch), which proceeded
through the mountainous regions of the Tras-os-Montes,
and passed the Esla river, the French falling back on
Toro. Pressing forward upon their numerous enemies,
the British forced them to quit one position after another,
until the legions of France were concentrated in the
plain of <em>Vittoria</em>, under Joseph Bonaparte, titular King
of Spain, where they prepared to oppose the victorious
career of the allied army. In the battle of the 21st
of June the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> formed part of the centre
column, under the immediate command of Lord Wellington,
and their bearing throughout the day, which
ended in the complete overthrow and discomfiture of
the French army, was afterwards rewarded with the
Royal authority to bear the word "<span class="smcap">Vittoria</span>" on the
colours of the regiment. Their loss was four men
killed and six wounded.</p>

<p>The following officers served at the battle of Vittoria,&mdash;viz.:</p>

<p><em>Colonel</em> G. R. Bingham. <em>Captains</em> O. G. Fehrszen
and James Mackay. <em>Lieutenants</em> C. F. Hunter, Thomas
Impett, James Hamilton, Thomas Dowker, and John
Fraser. <em>Ensigns</em> George Fitzgerald, Michael Nagle,
and John Wilton. <em>Adjutant</em> John Carss. <em>Surgeon</em>
Thomas Sandell; <em>Assistant-Surgeon</em> Charles MacLean.
Volunteer John Fernandez.</p>

<p>From the field of battle the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> followed
the rear of the defeated French army to the vicinity of
Pampeluna, and were afterwards employed in the
attempt to intercept General Clauzel's French
division, which had not been at the battle of Vittoria:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
this body of troops having escaped by the pass
of Jaca, the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> were employed in the blockade
of Pampeluna; but were relieved by the Spaniards
in the middle of July, and advanced into the Pyrenean
mountains, where they were stationed in support
of the troops occupying the head of the pass of Roncesvalles.</p>

<p>When the French army under Marshal Soult advanced
to resume offensive operations, the allied army
retired to a position in the <em>Pyrenees</em> in front of Pampeluna,
where some severe fighting took place, and
the repeated attacks of the French were repulsed.
Speaking of the action on the 28th of July, Lord
Wellington stated&mdash;"In the course of this contest, the
fourth division, which has so frequently been distinguished
in this army, surpassed its former good
conduct." On the 30th of July the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
regiment had an opportunity of distinguishing itself,
during the severely contested action in the mountains;
and the light infantry, commanded by Captain <span class="smcap">Fehrszen</span>,
of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>, signalized themselves in a particular
manner. The meritorious conduct of Captain <span class="smcap">Fehrszen</span>
was rewarded with the rank of major. The French
were driven from their post, and pursued to their own
frontiers: and the word "<span class="smcap">Pyrenees</span>" on the colours
of the regiment commemorates the heroic conduct of
the officers and soldiers of the second battalion on this
occasion. Their loss was three men killed and twenty-one
wounded.</p>

<p>The following officers served at the battle of the
Pyrenees:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Lieut.-Colonel</em> <span class="smcap">G. R. Bingham</span>. <em>Captains</em> O. G.
Fehrszen and James Mackay. <em>Lieutenants</em> C. F. Hunter,
Thomas Impett, James Hamilton, and Thos. Dowker.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
<em>Ensigns</em> George Fitzgerald, Michael Nagle, and John
Wilton. <em>Pay-Master</em> J. MacLean. <em>Adjutant</em> John
Carss. <em>Quarter-Master</em> R. Blackie. <em>Surgeon</em> T. Sandall.
<em>Assistant-Surgeon</em> C. MacLean.</p>

<p>Pursuing the French army through the mountains,
the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> captured some prisoners and baggage,
and arrived at Puerto de Echalar on the 2nd of August,
when Major-General Barnes's brigade was engaged
with two French divisions, which it drove from the
heights. Five days afterwards the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> were
removed to the vicinity of Lezaca, where the head-quarters
of the allied army were established; from this
place a few volunteers of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> proceeded
to <em>St. Sebastian</em>, and were engaged in storming that
fortress on the 31st of August, when two men of the
regiment were killed and two wounded. On the same
day the French crossed the Bidassoa in considerable
force, and attacked the Spanish troops on the heights
of San Marcial. On this occasion the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> were
engaged in extended order in the pass of <em>St. Antonio</em>,
where they had one man killed and twenty wounded.
The French were repulsed, and giving up all hope of
being able to relieve St. Sebastian, they re-crossed the
river.</p>

<p>At the passage of the <em>Bidassoa</em> on the 7th of October,
the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> supported the light division; and
during the action on the following day they were in
reserve.</p>

<p>Looking down from the lofty Pyrenees on the well
guarded territory of France, the British Commander
prepared to carry the war into the heart of that kingdom,
and on the morning of the 10th of November his
conquering divisions traversed the mountain passes by
moonlight, to attack the enemy's fortified position on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the <em>Nivelle</em>. The <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> carried bags filled with
fern, to fill up the ditch, and small ladders to mount the
rampart of a redoubt, which they were directed to take.
Advancing under the cover of a heavy cannonade, the
soldiers raised a loud and confident shout, as they
approached the redoubt, when the French fired a few
shots and fled. The redoubt was taken possession of,
and about thirty of the enemy, who had not time to
escape, were made prisoners. The British were successful
at every point, and the French made a retreat.
During the action Major <span class="smcap">Fehrszen</span> had an opportunity
of making a sudden dash with a few men, and he succeeded
in capturing a field gun. For their gallant
services on this occasion the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> were rewarded
with the Royal authority to bear the word
"<span class="smcap">Nivelle</span>" on their colours, in addition to the other
inscriptions previously acquired.</p>

<p>One serjeant and three private soldiers were killed;
Major Fehrszen, Captain Mackay, Lieutenant Hamilton,
and a few private soldiers wounded.</p>

<p>Names of officers who served at the battle of Nivelle:&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Lieut.-Colonel</em> G. R. Bingham. <em>Major</em> O. G. Fehrszen.
<em>Captains</em> James Mackay and John Carss. <em>Lieutenants</em>
C. F. Hunter, Tho. Impett, Tho. Dowker, James
Hamilton, and John Fraser. <em>Ensigns</em> George Fitzgerald
and M. Nagle. <em>Adjutant</em> John Wilton. <em>Assistant-Surgeons</em>
James Dunn and Charles MacLean.</p>

<p>At the passage of the Nive river, on the 9th of
December, and in the actions which followed, the
<span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> were in reserve, and did not sustain any
loss: they subsequently went into cantonments during
the severe weather which followed.</p>

<p>Some movements were made by the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the early part of January, 1814; and on the 6th of
that month they advanced to attack a body of French
troops; but were prevented engaging by a brook, the
stream of which was so swollen by the rains as to be
impassable. The battalion was afterwards stationed at
Ustaritz, where it remained until the middle of February,
when active operations were commenced against
the French army. After taking part in several movements,
the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> marched to St. Jean de Luz,
where they arrived on the 22nd of February, and were
supplied with new clothing at that place.</p>

<p>On the 25th of February the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> commenced
their march to re-join the army; but were not
in time to take part in the battle of Orthes on the
27th of that month. They passed the Adour at St.
Sever on the 3rd of March, and joined the fourth
division at Grenade, where they remained a week, and
afterwards marched in the direction of Bordeaux,
which city was taken possession of by the troops under
Marshal Beresford; the population renounced their
allegiance to the Emperor Napoleon, and declared
themselves in favour of the Bourbon dynasty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1814</div>

<p>In the meantime the six companies which returned
to England in January, 1813, had been so successful in
recruiting, and in obtaining volunteers from the militia,
that they were reported fit for service, and embarked
at Portsmouth on the 1st of March, 1814, to join the
allied army; they landed at Passages in Spain under
the orders of Lieut.-Colonel Mansel, and advancing
through the mountains into France, continued their
march to Tarbes, where they arrived on the 30th of
March, and were halted for the purpose of carrying on
operations against the castle of <em>L'Ourde</em>, which remained
in the possession of the enemy. Lieut.-Colonel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Mansel joined the army and took the command of the
second provisional battalion, Lieut.-Colonel Bingham
having returned to England on leave of absence about
two months previously.</p>

<p>The four companies of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>, forming
part of the second provisional battalion, had been withdrawn
from the road to Bordeaux, and proceeded to
the vicinity of <em>Toulouse</em>, where Marshal Soult had assembled
the French army to arrest the progress of
the allies, who did not receive the news of the abdication
of Napoleon until the 12th of April. Marshal
Soult's position was attacked on the 10th of April,
on which occasion the four companies formed part
of the force which turned the enemy's right, and
carried the heights on that flank. On ascending the
heights, the second provisional battalion encountered
a French brigade, in column, which was soon
routed. The enemy was driven from his positions;
and the word "<span class="smcap">Toulouse</span>" on the colours of the regiment
commemorates the gallant bearing of the officers
and soldiers of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> on this occasion. The
four companies had a few men killed and wounded;
Lieutenant Hamilton died of his wounds, much regretted,
being an officer of great promise. Captains
Mackay and Mansel, and Lieutenant Impett, were
wounded, and recovered.</p>

<p>Marshal Soult having retired from Toulouse, the

town; and the six companies of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>, from
England, arrived and joined the fourth division.</p>

<p>Hostilities were soon afterwards terminated; the
island of Elba was ceded to Napoleon Bonaparte in full
sovereignty, with the imperial title for life; the Bourbon
family was restored to the throne of France; and the
victorious soldiers of the allied army were thus rewarded
with a complete triumph over the enemies of their
country. The Royal authority was afterwards given for
the word "<span class="smcap">Peninsula</span>" to be added to the honorary
inscriptions on the colours of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>, to commemorate
their meritorious services in Portugal, Spain,
and the south of France, where they had fought and
conquered for the welfare of Europe.</p>

<p>After reposing a few weeks in convenient quarters,
the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> marched to the vicinity of Bordeaux,
where they were encamped a short period, and received
the thanks of Lieut.-General Sir Lowry Cole,
commanding the fourth division, in orders;&mdash;Colonel
Bingham and Lieut.-Colonel Mansel being particularly
mentioned. They were also reviewed by the Marquis
of Wellington, whose congratulations and expressions
of approbation were communicated to the army in
general orders, and they afterwards embarked for
Ireland. They landed at Monkstown on the 7th of
July, and marched to Kinsale, but re-embarked on the
23rd of that month, for England, and landing at Portsmouth,
proceeded from thence to Hilsea barracks, where
Colonel Bingham joined and assumed the command.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1815</div>

<p>During this period <span class="smcap">Napoleon Bonaparte</span> had returned
to France, his army had been overthrown at
<span class="smcap">Waterloo</span>, and he had surrendered himself to Captain
Maitland, commanding the Bellerophon ship of war:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the island of St. Helena was afterwards appointed
for his future residence. The second battalion of
the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment, having been very successful
in recruiting, was selected to accompany Bonaparte
to the island named as the place of exile for this extraordinary
man. The battalion embarked from Portsmouth
on the 1st of August, under the command of
Major Fehrszen; Colonel Sir George Bingham<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> commanding
the troops employed in this service. It arrived
at St. Helena in October, and after <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'occupy  the barracks'">occupying the
barracks</ins> at James Town a few days, proceeded to the
interior of the island, where new barracks were constructed,
and it furnished the requisite guards, piquets,
and sentries for the cordon of General Bonaparte.</p>

<p>At this period the serjeants of the battalion, who
had distinguished themselves in the Peninsula, were
presented with medals to be worn on their left breasts.
The medals were issued by Colonel Sir George Bingham,
in compliance with directions from the colonel of
the regiment, Lieut.-General Sir John Abercromby,
G.C.B., and were delivered to the following serjeants:&mdash;</p>

<p>During this year the second battalion remained on
duty at St. Helena, where it received the thanks of
the Governor, Lieut.-General Sir Hudson Lowe: in
May Lieut.-Colonel Mansel arrived and assumed the
command.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1817</div>

<p>The second battalion of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> remained
on duty at St. Helena until July of this year, when the
continued peace of Europe occasioning a considerable
reduction in the army, it was ordered to return to England
to be disbanded. It transferred thirteen serjeants,
one drummer, and two hundred and eighty-eight rank
and file to the first battalion in India; and embarking
from St. Helena in the middle of July, received, previous
to going on board of the ship "Baring," the
expression, in general orders, of the Governor's approbation
and admiration of its conduct while at St.
Helena. Previous to the officers of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
quitting the island, Napoleon Bonaparte expressed a
wish for them to wait on him, and the Governor having
consented, they attended at the residence of Napoleon.
He expressed his thankfulness for the manner in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
which the corps had performed the duties on which it
had been employed, and for the attention and respect
he had always experienced from every individual
belonging to it; and also expressed his wishes for the
prosperity and happiness of every member of the
corps.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">William Whitmore</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 21st December, 1755</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">William Whitmore</span> served many years in the third foot
guards; he was promoted to the rank of colonel in January,
1751; and in November, 1752, he was appointed major in his
regiment. In the winter of 1755&ndash;6 he raised, formed, and
disciplined a regiment of foot, now the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>, of which
he was appointed colonel by commission dated the 21st of
December, 1755. He was promoted to the rank of major-general
in January, 1758, and removed to the ninth regiment
of foot in October following. In December, 1760, he was
advanced to the rank of lieut.-general. His decease occurred
in 1771; at which period he was member of parliament for
Portsmouth.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">John Toovey</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 5th April, 1759</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">John Toovey</span> was a cavalry officer of reputation in the reign
of King George II., and served some years in the thirteenth
dragoons. In December, 1754, he was nominated to the lieut.-colonelcy
of the first royal dragoons; and in April, 1759, his
constant attention to all the duties of commanding officer was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
rewarded with the colonelcy of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment.
In August, 1761, he was promoted to the rank of major-general.
He died in 1770.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Robert Dalrymple Horne Elphinstone</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 5th February, 1770</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent">This Officer held a commission in the first, the royal regiment
of foot, many years, and was promoted to the lieut.-colonelcy
of the first battalion of that corps on the 20th of June, 1753.
On the 3rd of August, 1762, King George III. nominated him
to the colonelcy of the 120th regiment, which was raised in
the beginning of that year, and disbanded in 1764. In
February, 1770, he was appointed Colonel of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
regiment; and was promoted to the rank of major-general
two months afterwards. In 1777 he was advanced to the rank
of lieut.-general; and in 1793 to that of general. He died
in 1794.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Gerard Lake</span>,</p>

<p class="center">Afterwards Viscount Lake,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 3rd April, 1794</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Gerard Lake</span>, third son of Lancelot Charles Lake, Esq.,
choosing the profession of arms, was nominated to the commission
of ensign and lieutenant in the first foot guards, on the 9th of
May, 1758; in 1762 he was promoted to lieutenant and
captain, and in 1776 to captain and lieut.-colonel. He served
in North America during the War of Independence; was engaged
in operations in the southern states, under Major-General
the Earl Cornwallis, and had opportunities of distinguishing
himself. When Earl Cornwallis's force was
besieged in York Town, by the united French and American
armies, Lieut.-Colonel Lake commanded a detachment of foot
guards and grenadiers of the eightieth regiment, which made
a sortie on the 16th of October, 1781, forced the entrenchments,
spiked eleven heavy guns, and killed and wounded about a
hundred French soldiers. On the surrender of York Town
he became a prisoner of war; but hostilities were terminated
soon afterwards, and he returned to England; having been
promoted to the rank of colonel in February, 1782. In 1784
he was nominated major, and in 1792 lieut.-colonel in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
first foot guards. In 1790 he was advanced to the rank of
major-general. On the breaking out of the French revolutionary
war, he was nominated to the command of the brigade
of foot guards which proceeded to Flanders, and served under
His Royal Highness the Duke of York. He commanded this
brigade at the battle of Famars, and at the siege of Valenciennes;
and highly distinguished himself at Lincelles, on
the 18th of August, 1793, for which he was thanked in general
orders. He also served before Dunkirk, and in other operations:
and in 1794 he was rewarded with the colonelcy of
the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment, and the government of Limerick:
he was afterwards nominated governor of Dumbarton. In
1796 he was removed to the seventy-third regiment: in 1797
he was promoted to the rank of lieut.-general, and placed on
the staff of Ireland, where he evinced talent and energy in
suppressing the rebellion which broke out in 1798, and gained
several important victories over the insurgents. When
the French landed in Ireland, he was obliged to retire a short
distance; but additional troops advancing to his aid, he intercepted
the French soldiers and forced them to surrender
prisoners of war. In 1800 he was appointed Commander-in-Chief
in India, and colonel of the eightieth regiment; and in
1802 he was promoted to the rank of general. He arrived in
India at the period when the Governor-General, the Marquis
Wellesley, was displaying the energies of his mind in counteracting
the intrigues of France among the native powers of
Hindoostan; and the ambitious designs of the Mahratta chiefs
soon called General <span class="smcap">Lake</span> into the field, when his talents
were conspicuously displayed. His spirited and judicious
operations at Coel, on the 29th of August, 1803; the assault
of Aly Ghur, on the 9th of September; and the overthrow of
the Mahratta army near Delhi, on the 11th of September, on
which occasion his charger was killed under him, produced
decisive results. The country between the Ganges and Jumna
rivers, called the Doab (a general name in India for the
space between two rivers), became subject to British authority;
and six days afterwards General Lake visited the Emperor, Shah
Alum, whom he had rescued from oppression, and who conferred
upon him titles which signified,&mdash;The Saver of the State,&mdash;Hero
of the Land,&mdash;Lord of the Age,&mdash;and the Victorious
in War.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Afterwards proceeding to Agra, General Lake speedily
captured that place, and on the 1st of November he gained
an important victory at Leswaree, when the French-officered
battalions of Dowlat Rao Scindia were annihilated, the
Mahratta army overpowered, and its colours, artillery, and
baggage captured. His services on this occasion were of a
distinguished character; he led the charge of the cavalry in
the morning;&mdash;conducted in person the attacks of the infantry,
and in the midst of the storm of battle he displayed valour,
professional ability, promptitude, and decision; his magnanimous
example inspired confidence and emulation in the troops,
and they triumphed over very superior numbers. Two
horses were killed under him on this occasion.</p>

<p>His important services were rewarded, in 1804, with the
title of <span class="smcap">Lord Lake of Delhi and Leswaree</span>.</p>

<p>Pursuing the war with vigour, <span class="smcap">Lord Lake</span> routed the
power of Holkar at Furruckabad; but the war was protracted
by the defection of the Rajah of Bhurtpore; and when his
Lordship besieged the city of Bhurtpore, he failed in capturing
the place from the want of a battering-train. The Rajah of
Bhurtpore was, however, brought to terms; and Lord Lake
pursued the hostile Rajah of Berar from place to place, until
this chief was brought to submission. The British military
power in the East was strengthened by these successes, and
the extent and stability of the dominions in India increased.</p>

<p>His Lordship returned to England, and in 1807 he was
advanced to the dignity of <span class="smcap">Viscount Lake</span>.</p>

<p>He caught cold while sitting on the general court-martial
which tried Major-General Whitelocke; and died on the 30th
of February, 1808.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Welbore Ellis Doyle</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 2nd November, 1796</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent">This Officer served in the army during the American war,
and on the 21st of March, 1782, he was appointed lieut.-colonel
of the 105th regiment of foot, then newly raised by
Francis Lord Rawdon. This corps was disbanded at the
termination of the American war; and in 1789 he was
nominated to the lieut.-colonelcy of the fourteenth foot, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the head of which regiment he distinguished himself in
Flanders under His Royal Highness the Duke of York. He
was promoted to the rank of colonel in 1793, and to that of
major-general in 1795; in 1796 he was nominated colonel
of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment. He died in 1798.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">Charles Crosbie</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 3rd January, 1798</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Charles Crosbie</span> was appointed captain in the eighty-sixth
regiment on the 24th of August, 1759, and he served with
this corps on the coast of Africa, being stationed some time
at Senegal. He was promoted to the rank of major, and
afterwards to that of lieut.-colonel in the eighty-sixth, which
regiment was disbanded after the termination of the seven
years' war. In 1778 he was nominated lieut.-colonel of the
sixty-seventh regiment; was promoted to the rank of colonel
in 1780, and to that of major-general in 1787. In 1794 he
was nominated colonel of the Royal Dublin regiment of foot,
which was embodied at that period, and disbanded soon afterwards.
He was appointed colonel of the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
regiment in January, 1797, and promoted to the rank of lieut.-general
in December following: in 1802 he was promoted to
the rank of general. He died on the 18th of March, 1807.</p>


<p class="p2 center"><span class="smcap">The Honorable John Abercromby</span>,</p>

<p class="center"><em>Appointed 21st March, 1807</em>.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">John Abercromby</span> was the second son of the celebrated
General <span class="smcap">Sir Ralph Abercromby</span>, K.B., who commanded
the expedition to Egypt, and was mortally wounded at the
battle of Alexandria, on the 21st of March, 1801, thus terminating
an honorable life with a glorious death in the hour of
victory. As a reward for his gallant conduct his widow was
created <span class="smcap">Baroness Abercromby</span> of Aboukir, and of Tullibody
in the county of Clackmannan, by patent dated the 28th
of May, 1801.</p>

<p>On the 13th of April, 1782, John Abercromby was appointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
cornet in the fifth, the Royal Irish dragoons; and in 1787,
when the seventy-fifth regiment was raised by Colonel Robert
Abercromby, he was appointed lieutenant in that corps; in
1792 he was promoted captain in the same corps. He served
in Flanders under His Royal Highness the Duke of York;
and obtained the rank of lieut.-colonel in 1794. In 1795 he
was appointed lieut.-colonel in the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment,
which corps he commanded at the capture of St. Lucia, in
1796, and distinguished himself in the action at the pass of
Morne Chabot, for which he was thanked in orders. He
commanded the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> in the Caribbee war in St.
Vincent in 1796,&mdash;at the capture of Trinidad, in February,
1797,&mdash;and at the unsuccessful attempt on Porto Rico, in
April of the same year, under his father, Lieut.-General Sir
Ralph Abercromby. In 1800 he was promoted to the rank
of colonel, and in 1805 to that of major-general: on the 21st
of March, 1807, he was nominated to the colonelcy of the
<span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment. He obtained the rank of lieut.-general
in 1812, and was afterwards placed on the staff of the
army in India, where he served two years as governor of
Madras, and commander-in-chief of the coast army; but in
September, 1814, he resigned his appointments to return to
Europe for the benefit of his health. He was afterwards
honored with the dignity of Knight Grand Cross of the Order
of the Bath. Proceeding to Marseilles, in the south of France,
for the benefit of his health, he died at that place on the
14th of February, 1817, and was buried with military honors, by
the French garrison; the funeral was attended by the French
authorities, civil and military, of the department and of the
city, and also by the consuls of several nations.</p>

<p>In announcing the death of Lieut.-General the Honorable
<span class="smcap">Sir John Abercromby</span>, G.C.B., in regimental orders,
Colonel Sir George Bingham stated,&mdash;"The length of time
he has served in the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment,&mdash;his great
attachment to the corps,&mdash;the interest he took in its welfare,
as well as in that of every individual belonging to it, will
cause him to be particularly regretted by those not personally
acquainted with him; while his high military abilities and
upright private character will occasion his loss to be regarded
as a calamity to the service."</p>

company, from which he was removed to the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
regiment, which proceeded to Flanders at the commencement
of the French revolutionary war in 1793, and distinguished
itself. In the same year he raised an independent company,
was promoted to the rank of captain, and appointed to the
eighty-sixth regiment, or Shropshire volunteers, then raised
by Major-General Cuyler. He accompanied Mr. Drake on a
mission to Genoa, and afterwards proceeded to Toulon, where
he served as aide-de-camp to the three successive generals
commanding there, viz., Lord Mulgrave, Lieut.-General
O'Hara, and Sir David Dundas; and was wounded at the
attack of the heights of Arenes, on the 30th of November,
1793, and narrowly escaped with his life, when Lieut.-General
O'Hara was taken prisoner. On the evacuation of Toulon,
he was sent with despatches to England. In 1794 he was
promoted to a majority in the ninetieth regiment, raised
at this period by Thomas Graham Esq., (of Balgowan, Perthshire,)
afterwards General Lord Lynedoch; and in the same
year to a lieut.-colonelcy in that corps. He served at Isle
Dieu on the coast of France, at Gibraltar, Malta, and Minorca;
on the 1st of January, 1800, he was promoted to the rank of
Colonel, and commanded the ninetieth regiment in the expedition
to Egypt under General Sir Ralph Abercromby,
distinguishing himself during the action on the 13th of March,
1801, when his regiment was at the head of the right column,
and repulsed a charge of cavalry with great gallantry. Colonel
Hill fell from the blow of a musket-ball on the right temple,
and was removed in a state of insensibility, but recovered;
the force of the ball having been resisted by a strong brass
binding in front of his helmet. On his return to England
he was promoted to the rank of brigadier-general, and placed
on the staff of Ireland, where he was presented with the
freedom of Cork. He was promoted to the rank of major-general,
and served in the expedition to Hanover, under Lord
Cathcart, in 1805; and in 1808 he embarked from Ireland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
with a brigade of infantry, to serve in the Peninsula, where
he speedily gave presage of those military virtues which
adorned his character. He commanded a brigade at the
battles of Roleia, and Vimiera, under Sir Arthur Wellesley;
and during the advance into Spain under Sir John Moore,
and the corps under his orders covered the embarkation at
Corunna. He acquired fresh honors at the passage of the
Douro at Oporto, on the 12th of May, 1809, when he commanded
the corps which first passed the river, after Lieut.-General
Sir E. Paget was wounded: and at the battle of
Talavera he again distinguished himself, particularly in
repulsing the attack of the French on the hill on the left of
the position; he was wounded in the head on this occasion.
His services during the whole of the campaigns in the Peninsula
and South of France were of a distinguished character, and
have called forth the commendations of historians, the praises
of Field-Marshal the Duke of Wellington, the thanks of Parliament,
the approbation of his Sovereign, and the gratitude
of his country. During the early part of 1811, he was
absent from the army on account of ill health: but he
returned to his post in the month of May with the rank of
lieut.-general, and was placed in command of the troops in
Estremadura. His abilities were conspicuously displayed in
the surprise of a body of French troops at Arroyo dos Molinos,
in October, 1811; in the capture of the forts and the
destruction of the bridge at Almaraz, in May, 1812; and at
the battle of the Nive, on the 13th December, 1813. His
reputation was constantly augmented, and his talents, energy,
and sound judgment became more conspicuous as the extent of
his command was increased, and the nature of his services became
difficult. His claim to military eminence was not established
by a few solitary acts of courage and skill; but by a career
of brilliant service, which will descend to posterity interwoven
with the triumphs of the Duke of Wellington, whose victories
were followed by the overthrow of the power of Napoleon,
and the restoration of the Bourbon dynasty to the throne of
France. The services of Lieut.-General Sir Rowland Hill
were rewarded with the dignity of <span class="smcap">Baron Hill of Almaraz</span>,
and of Hawkstone in the county of Salop, by patent dated the
17th of May, 1814.</p>

<p>When the return of Bonaparte to France re-kindled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
war in Europe, Lieut.-General <span class="smcap">Lord Hill</span> was selected to
hold an important command in the army in Flanders under
Field-Marshal the Duke of Wellington; and he was placed
at the head of a corps of the allied army at the memorable battle
of Waterloo, on the 18th of June, 1815, when the power of
Bonaparte was annihilated by British skill and valour, and
peace was acquired for Europe. The honorary distinctions
conferred upon <span class="smcap">Lord Hill</span> for his important services, were,&mdash;Knight
Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath,&mdash;Knight Grand
Cross of the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order,&mdash;a medal for
the battle of Waterloo,&mdash;a cross and three clasps for the battles
of Roleia, Vimiera, Corunna, Talavera, Vittoria, Pyrenees,
Nivelle, Nive, and Orthes; the Turkish Order of the Crescent,&mdash;Grand
Cross of the Tower and Sword of Portugal, Commander
of Maria Theresa of Austria,&mdash;St. George of Russia, and
Wilhelm of Holland. He was presented with the freedom of
the city of London; and was appointed governor of Hull,
and Colonel of the ninety-fourth regiment. In 1817 he was
removed to the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span> regiment.</p>

<p>In 1825 <span class="smcap">Lord Hill</span> was promoted to the rank of general;
and on the 15th of February, 1828, he was appointed General
Commanding in Chief, the important duties of which appointment
he performed with reputation and advantage to the service
fourteen years. He was appointed Colonel of the Royal
Regiment of Horse Guards, and Governor of Plymouth, in
1830. His Lordship's resignation of the command of the
Army, in August, 1842, was announced in the following
General Order:</p>

<p class="p2 right">
"<span class="smcap">Horse Guards</span>, <em>15th August, 1842</em>.<br />
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">General Lord Hill</span> finds it necessary to resign the Command
of the Army on account of his Lordship's present state
of health, and Her Majesty has been graciously pleased to
accept his Lordship's resignation.</p>

<p>"When Lord Hill assumed the command which he now
resigns, he expressed, in General Orders, his confident hope,
that from the General and other Officers, as well as from the
Public Departments of the Army, he should receive that support
which should enable him to fulfil the important trust
reposed in him.</p>

<p>"That hope has not been disappointed, but, on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
realized beyond Lord Hill's most sanguine expectation.</p>

<p>"The conduct of the Troops has, both in the Field and in
Quarters, furnished, during Lord Hill's command of them, an
example of discipline, regularity, and general efficiency, not
to be surpassed, and the Officers have, by their devotion to
their duty, enabled his Lordship to maintain the Army in that
creditable state. The Officers have, therefore, established their
claim to Lord Hill's lasting gratitude and esteem.</p>

<p>"His Lordship cannot, then, but with painful feelings take
leave of Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers, and Soldiers,
whose conduct has been so uniformly approved by their
Sovereign and by their Country.</p>

<p>"These feelings are, however, greatly alleviated and consoled
by the reflection that the Command of the Army is now to
be resumed by the Duke of Wellington, the ever vigilant and
most influential Guardian of its Interests, and whose achievements
have raised its character to the highest Pinnacle of
Glory."</p></div>

<p>On the 3rd of September, 1842, Lord Hill was advanced
to the dignity of Viscount, by Her Majesty, in consideration of
his eminent military services, and in approbation of the
ability with which His Lordship had discharged, for a
lengthened period, the important duties of General Commanding-in-Chief.</p>

<p>The decease of General Lord Hill occurred on the 10th
December, 1842, in the seventy-first year of his age, at
Hardwicke Grange, Shrewsbury.</p>

<p class="p2 pfs90">MEMOIR OF THE SERVICES OF MAJOR-GENERAL
SIR GEORGE R. BINGHAM, K.C.B.</p>


<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Sir George Ridout Bingham</span> entered the army in June,
1793, as ensign in the sixty-ninth regiment, and served at
Corsica and in the Mediterranean. He was promoted to
captain in the eighty-first in 1796, and major in the eighty-second
in 1801, and he served with those corps at the Cape of
Good Hope and the island of Minorca. On the 14th of
March, 1805, he was nominated lieut.-colonel in the <span class="fs70">FIFTY-THIRD</span>
regiment, and assuming the command of the second
battalion in Ireland, on the 1st of April, he was at the head of
that portion of the regiment during the whole of its arduous
and distinguished service in the Peninsula, commencing with
the expulsion of Marshal Soult's army from Oporto in 1809,
and continued until the end of 1812, when the battalion was
so reduced in numbers, that six companies returned to England
to recruit; and during these campaigns his conduct reflected
honour on the corps to which he belonged. In 1813 he commanded
with reputation the second provisional battalion. He
received a cross and one clasp for the battles of Talavera,
Salamanca, Vittoria, Pyrenees, and Nivelle; he was also
nominated Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, and
received permission to accept of the Order of the Tower and
Sword of Portugal. He commanded the troops which
proceeded to St. Helena with Napoleon Bonaparte, in 1815,
and served as brigadier-general at that island until 1820, when
he returned to England in consequence of having been promoted
to the rank of major-general in 1819. In 1831 he was
appointed colonel commandant of a battalion of the Rifle
Brigade. He served on the staff of Ireland from 1825 to
1832. He died in 1833. As a soldier and a gentleman he
stood high in the estimation of all who knew him; he was an
ornament to his profession and an honour to his country.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
